00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:02,120

Good afternoon, dear listeners.


2

00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,160

Today we will look at
scientific citation systems


3

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:10,400

and how to use them to extract
maximum benefit for the dissertation candidate.


4

00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,520

The Scientific Citation System is an electronic bibliographic database,


5

00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,280

containing some analytical
information about publications,


6

00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,760

These include scientific journals, book publications, and patents.


7

00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,200

Scientific citation systems are necessary to


8

00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:31,240

to discover scientific works,
as well as evaluate and analyze them,


9

00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:38,259

not only them, but also publications,
and publication activity of authors.


10

00:00:38,259 --> 00:00:41,480

There are international systems
scientific citation, there are two of them,


11

00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,560

this is the Web of Science system, owned by the American company Thomson Scientific,


12

00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:53,440

and the Scopus system, owned by the Dutch company Elsevier.


13

00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,720

Both of these systems are generally accepted
they publish several thousand scientific papers a year


14

00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:07,880

and therefore are quite complete,
and they are convenient to use for scientific research.


15

00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,640

However, today
on the territory of the Russian Federation


16

00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:15,880

direct access to these systems,
unfortunately, it is significantly limited.


17

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:21,680

In addition, to international bases
scientific citations are not all included


18

00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,080

scientific publications published in Russia,
therefore in the Russian Federation there is


19

00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,240

own scientific citation database,
it's called eLibrary,


20

00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:38,120

and its developer is
electronic scientific library eLibrary.


21

00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,520

There is its own
science citation index,


22

00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:45,600

it's called "Russian"
Science Citation Index".


23

00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,640

In addition to articles in scientific journals,
The eLibrary database includes reports at conferences,


24

00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:56,080

monographs, textbooks,
as well as patents and dissertations.


25

00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,880

ELibrary solves a number of problems for various
categories of users.


26

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,080

We are interested in you and me
categories of readers and authors.


27

00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,520

eLibrary Challenges for Readers
is, in fact, a search for a catalog of magazines,


28

00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,000

this is a search by author, subject index and some scientific publishing houses,


29

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,440

about which we can learn, in fact,
using this system.


30

00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,960

In addition, for authors
this is Science Index, or scientific index,


31

00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,200

my colleagues will tell you about it in more detail,


32

00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,920

and this is the Russian Science Citation Index - as the main one. It is assigned to all authors,


33

00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,640

who have ever published their work on the territory of the Russian Federation.


34

00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,520

So, we are on the start page
scientific electronic library eLibrary.


35

00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:48,600

Here is the site interface,


36

00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:56,400

and we see several tabs with information for different categories of users.


37

00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,040

What is useful to readers is, in fact, collections of publications, search queries and groups,


38

00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,920

which you can customize for yourself.


39

00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:11,320

For organizations and publishing houses
there is also information


40

00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,600

The same information is available for authors - these are instructions on how to register,


41

00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:25,320

it’s like getting your own Science Index and some advice to help young scientists.


42

00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:31,520

What else is important here...
This is, in fact, a literary search.


43

00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,320

We can make it happen with you
basic literature search, e.g.


44

00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,680

by one or more keywords,


45

00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,760

and the search results obtained
somehow analyze


46

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,120

you see that there is an icon,
which means access to the full text.


47

00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:57,800

Some publications are not available
in full text format,


48

00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,200

and, let’s say, you can watch them either


49

00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,240

on the publisher’s website, or get only some bibliographic information on them.


50

00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:15,120

In addition, you can use the navigator to search, that is, search according to various criteria,


51

00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:18,880

for example, by authors,
you can find your own profile this way


52

00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,880

and see the analytics for yourself
or according to other authors,


53

00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,840

if you are interested in searching
for this category.


54

00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,840

Or configure it initially
extended literature search.


55

00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,600

Advanced Literature Search
carried out in several categories,


56

00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,480

for example, we are looking for publication type
with the keyword “biosensor”,


57

00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:49,520

when this keyword is only in the title of the publication,


58

00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:59,560

and these, for example, are only scientific articles.


59

00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,760

We are already getting significantly less
number of publications, but nevertheless


60

00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:05,920

there are still a lot of them.


61

00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,480

To narrow down your search results, you need to be more specific, e.g.


62

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,520

by author's last name or year,


63

00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:18,200

when it is necessary to find the most recent or, conversely, fundamental works.


64

00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,960

In general, a literary search is carried out from large to small.


65

00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:35,200

If you are just entering this area,
or if you meet someone


66

00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:42,160
