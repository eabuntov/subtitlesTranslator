00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:05,360

Good afternoon, dear graduate students, young
scientists from the Ural Federal University!


2

00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:07,320

My name is Daria Telepaeva.


3

00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,480

I am the Chairman of the Council
young scientists of our university,


4

00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,400

candidate of sociological sciences


5

00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,920

and Associate Professor of the Department of Sociology
and technologies of state


6

00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,720

and the municipal administration of our university.


7

00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:26,760

Today I would like to tell you about this
an interesting and important topic for all young scientists,


8

00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,720

as support for our activities with you,
support for youth science.


9

00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,320

And today, as part of this lecture
we will discuss the federal level,


10

00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,240

that is, what the authorities do
throughout our country,


11

00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:45,280

and those support measures that
apply to all graduate students,


12

00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:48,720

for all young scientists of the Russian Federation.


13

00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,760

So, let's begin.


14

00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,760

The very first support measure mentioned
today I would like to tell you,


15

00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:59,920

these are Presidential scholarships and
Government of the Russian Federation.


16

00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,760

In order to receive this scholarship,


17

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,400

you must have outstanding abilities
in educational and scientific activities,


18

00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,840

you can be the winner of various
Olympiads, creative competitions,


19

00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,120

if you are studying in the relevant specialties,


20

00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,800

you must be the authors
discoveries, patents, inventions,


21

00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:25,640

you should also have
mandatory scientific articles


22

00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,280

in leading Russian or
foreign scientific publications.


23

00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,920

This scholarship is available to everyone
absolutely categories of graduate students,


24

00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,640

regardless of whether you study on a budget
or on a contract form of training.


25

00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,600

The amount of this scholarship varies.


26

00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:50,720

So the scholarship of the President of the Russian
Federation is 4,500 rubles. monthly,


27

00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,160

and a scholarship from the Russian Government
Federation is 3,600 rubles. monthly.


28

00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:01,640

These scholarships are paid for the academic year.


29

00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,120

At first glance you might think
that the size of these scholarships is insignificant.


30

00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:12,440

However, they are very prestigious and if you
are a recipient of the Presidential Scholarship


31

00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:18,160

or the Government of the Russian Federation,
then this is very honorable, very prestigious


32

00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,840

and is considered one of the highest
forms of achievements of your science,


33

00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,760

the research you
you are studying as a young scientist.


34

00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,000

The next support measure, oh
which I will tell differs in that


35

00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,720

that it is accessible to those
graduate students, those young scientists,


36

00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,160

who are trained in priority areas


37

00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,040

technological modernization
development of the Russian economy.


38

00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,680

I'm talking about the scholarship of the President and the Government
just in priority areas.


39

00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,560

Among other things, this scholarship
very important selection criterion


40

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,800

is your academic performance. You
must study "excellently"


41

00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,280

and it must be at least 50
% of your overall performance.


42

00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,640

You must also still have
outstanding achievements in scientific activity:


43

00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,400

these are the same Olympiads, competitions,


44

00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,320

receiving awards for research
the job you are doing.


45

00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:22,320

These are patents, developments,
the grants you have


46

00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:27,240

publications, speeches at
scientific conferences and so on.


47

00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,440

An important difference of this scholarship
from the previous two is that


48

00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:38,120

that your achievements are taken into account here
only in the last 2 years.


49

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,280

If the basic scholarships of the President and
Government of the Russian Federation


50

00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,480

take into account all your research
activities since then


51

00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,960

when you first started doing this,


52

00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:53,200

then scholarships from the President and the Government
in priority areas


53

00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,880

take into account your achievements
only in the last 2 years.


54

00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:02,120

And the amount of these scholarships is like
you see, already much higher:


55

00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,960

The President's stipend is
14,000 rub. monthly,


56

00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:14,800

and a scholarship from the Russian Government
Federation is 10,000 rubles. monthly.


57

00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,960

The next support measure I'll talk about is


58

00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,200

are grants from the Russian Science Foundation


59

00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,160

for the implementation of the Presidential
research project programs,


60

00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:28,680

which are being implemented by our young scientists.


61

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,560

It is important to note here that in this Presidential
The program has two types of grants.


62

00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:39,960

One of them is the so-called individual
competition - available to young scientists,


63

00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,440

who are engaged in their
research alone.


64

00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,320

And the second competition, which I’ll tell you about a little later,


65

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,200

available to research groups
under the guidance of young scientists.


66

00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:57,240

And I’ll start with the basic grant, there’s more
some call it “my first grant” -


67

00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,000

this is the implementation of the Presidential
research project programs,


68

00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,440

which a young scientist can
implement it yourself.


69

00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:10,480

To become a recipient
grant from the Russian Science Foundation,


70

00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:16,880

you must have an advanced degree
candidate or doctor of sciences,


71

00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:21,680

you should also have publications on
topic of the project, that is, on the topic


72

00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,760

which you submit as part of this project to
various publications that are indexed,


73

00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:33,840

or bibliographic databases, where
All our scientific publications are stored


74

00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,440

(this is Web of Science, Scopus and so on,


75

00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:44,840

or these are Russian sources, Russian bases
data, this is the RSCI you see on the screen).


76

00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,320

Regarding the number of publications,


77

00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:53,960

then to receive this grant
at least three publications are required,


78

00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,000

but for humanitarian and social
sciences there is a small benefit,


79

00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,760

and for representatives of precisely such sciences


80

00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:05,480

only two publications required
in similar sources.


81

00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,880

In addition, this project, which
you are applying for this competition,


82

00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,480

should be aimed at solving specific
tasks within one of the priorities,


83

00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,480

which are defined by the Strategy
scientific and technological


84

00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,880

development of the Russian Federation.


85

00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,480

This Strategy is available on the Internet,
you can always contact her


86

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,600

and check that direction
the research you are doing


87

00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,040

how consistent it is with this Strategy.


88

00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:40,520

The amount of this individual grant is
up to one and a half million and is paid annually.


89

00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,080

More detailed information as per
grants from the Russian Science Foundation,


90

00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,600

as well as for other support measures,


91

00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,600

which I have talked about and will talk about
in this presentation, in this lecture,


92

00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:59,519

you can check it out by going to
The QR code that is on these slides,


93

00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:02,360

and find out more detailed information there.


94

00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:06,320

Now let's talk about another grant
Russian Science Foundation,


95

00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,400

which is already available for scientific
groups led by young scientists.


96

00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,640

The requirements in this case are still


97

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,720

is the presence of an academic degree
from the leader of this team,


98

00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,320

also the presence of publications in similar or
Russian or foreign databases,


99

00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:33,280

but for scientific groups the leader of the scientific group
must already have at least five publications,


100

00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:37,440

and for humanitarian and
social sciences - at least three.


101

00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,120

It is important to understand that the leader
this competition, this project,


102

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,800

which you are submitting to the competition
Russian Science Foundation,


103

00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,920

there must be a young scientist who is under 35 years old
(both for the first competition and for the second).


104

00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:03,240

In our country, a young scientist is considered to be a person
who has not reached the age of 35 years inclusive.


105

00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:05,480

Accordingly, you as a project manager


106

00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:09,800

or an individual competition,
or a competition of small scientific groups


107

00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:15,440

under the guidance of young scientists,
you must not be over 35 years old.


108

00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,560

As before, the project within this
the competition must also be sent


109

00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:24,320

to solve specific problems in
within one of the priorities,


110

00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:29,240

which are determined by the same Strategy
scientific and technological development of our country.


111

00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:34,960

The size of such a grant for small scientific
groups led by young scientists


112

00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:42,120

already ranges from 3 to 5 million
rubles and is paid annually.


113

00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:46,280

Another measure of support, oh
which I can’t help but tell you,


114

00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,520

is the award of the President of the Russian Federation


115

00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:53,320

in the field of science and innovation for young scientists.


116

00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:58,080

This award is the highest form
gratitude in our country


117

00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,400

and is handed over personally by the President into the hands of one or


118

00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,400

several young scientists,
who receive this award.


119

00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,960

Russian Presidential Award
Federation is appointed every year,


120

00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,840

and you can apply every year
applications for this award.


121

00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,760

Regarding the selection criteria, it is important to understand


122

00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,280

that here you must already have outstanding
achievements in the field of science and technology,


123

00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,360

which are confirmed by publications, patents


124

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:34,880

and in various other ways to show that
you are truly an outstanding young scientist,


125

00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,280

that you have done a lot in
within the framework of its theme for our country,


126

00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,360

for the development of science, for the development
innovation, technology and so on.


127

00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,880

It is important to note that the recipients of this
prizes are usually scientists,


128

00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:53,920

who are already close to the age of 35
years, since all those achievements


129

00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,640

that you submit count towards your entire
scientific career, throughout your entire scientific life.


130

00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,680

Accordingly, the older you are, the
your achievements are most likely greater.


131

00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,680

The prize may be awarded
like one young scientist


132

00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,520

(that is, you can only apply
from myself), and to a team of young scientists,


133

00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:19,080

but in this team there should be
be no more than three people


134

00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:24,920

and each member of the scientific team
must be up to 35 years of age inclusive.


135

00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:28,000

In this case, you submit a collective application.


136

00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,960

And, as practice shows, it is the collective
applications have a chance to win this award,


137

00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:39,640

chances of receiving this award from
there are many more hands of the President,


138

00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:43,840

than those scientists who apply individually.


139

00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:49,960

The award amount is 5 million rubles
and the best thing about this award is that


140

00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:57,880

that it is not subject to any taxes, and you
You get the full price fairly quickly.


141

00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:03,640

The latest federal support measure
which I would like to tell you about today,


142

00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:09,200

are public housing
certificates for young scientists.


143

00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,840

Young scientist in order to get
this state housing certificate,


144

00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,800

must also be no older than 35 years of age.


145

00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,840

Among other things, he must, of course
same, have Russian citizenship,


146

00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,160

work experience at a university or scientific organization
you must be at least five years old.


147

00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:34,280

Of course you must have
PhD degree


148

00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:40,640

and status in need of improvement
living conditions at the place of work.


149

00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:46,520

It is important to note that the cost calculation
housing certificate varies.


150

00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:50,800

It depends on in what
region is the organization


151

00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,840

which puts you forward as
needing housing.


152

00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:59,920

Calculation of the cost of this housing
certificate is produced


153

00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:05,520

based on the size of the total area
living space of 33 sq.m.


154

00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:10,120

and the average market value of one
square meter in that region,


155

00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,280

where your organization is located.


156

00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:29,184

If we are talking about Sverdlovsk
region, then we currently have


157

00:12:29,184 --> 00:12:29,317

for 2023 the size of such a certificate
is approximately 3 million 300 thousand rubles.


158

00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:30,880

With this certificate you can
use in several cases.


159

00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:37,760

Firstly, you can use it to count
paying off a mortgage, for example, if you have one.


160

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,600

You can also use this certificate


161

00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:45,360

as a down payment for
in order to take out a mortgage.


162

00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,120

how are you officially appointed
recipient of this support measure.


168

00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:19,120

Dear graduate students, young scientists!
It is important to note that those support measures


169

00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,640

which I talked about
valid at the end of 2023.
