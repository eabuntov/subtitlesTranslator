00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,120

Good afternoon.


2

00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:04,160

Today we are discussing topic number 10 of our course,


3

00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,440

which is called “Research Ethics in the Digital Age.”


4

00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,200

My name is Ivanov Alexey Olegovich, I am a Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences,


5

00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,120

Professor, Deputy Vice-Rector for Science, Ural Federal University.


6

00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,160

At the same time, I head the Certification Council of the Ural Federal University


7

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,120

and I have been a member of the Higher Attestation for the fifth year


8

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,160

commission of the Russian Federation, that is, I am deeply immersed


9

00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,840

in all documentary procedures, regulations related to the preparation,


10

00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,560

defense and approval of dissertations, including dissertations for competition


11

00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,280

scientific degree of Candidate of Sciences, and Doctor of Sciences, of course, too.


12

00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:48,200

The Ural Federal University has the right to independently award academic degrees,


13

00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,440

and we work according to this Regulation.


14

00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,960

This is the title page of the Regulations on the award of academic degrees


15

00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,360

at the Federal State Autonomous Educational Institution


16

00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,240

higher education "Ural
federal university


17

00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:04,000

named after the first president of Russia Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin."


18

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,160

Several dozen other universities and institutes and academies of sciences in our country have such rights.


19

00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,320

And there is a lot of confusion here,


20

00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,800

which has, generally speaking, been present in our academic community for the last few years.


21

00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:24,120

The fact is that for some reason many people believe that UrFU awards its own degrees


22

00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:29,120

similar to PhD degrees,
which are awarded, for example, in Europe.


23

00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:33,800

This is completely wrong.
Ural Federal University awards


24

00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:38,680

state academic degrees, we are simply given the right to create ourselves


25

00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:43,560

dissertation advice based on
relevant regulatory documents


26

00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:47,040

(in particular, we have the Regulations on the dissertation council)


27

00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,320

and carry out defense procedures ourselves, conduct examinations ourselves,


28

00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,520

make the award themselves without seeking consent or consideration


29

00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,880

relevant documents in the Higher Attestation Commission.


30

00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:04,520

Moreover, all documents on academic degrees,


31

00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:09,720

awarded to UrFU are necessarily loaded into the Unified Information System


32

00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:15,800

state scientific certification and are constantly monitored by representatives of the Russian Ministry of Education and Science.


33

00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:19,800

But, in this regard, we will, of course, first of all, talk about the problems


34

00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,480

related to dissertation research, more precisely with what problems arise,


35

00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,840

including ethical ones, during defenses.


36

00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,960

This is an extract, a “piece” from our Regulations on the awarding of academic degrees, in which it is written


37

00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:41,240

the main criteria that dissertations for academic degrees must meet.


38

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,240

Each word highlighted here has a separate meaning.


39

00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:50,840

You can’t read them so slantedly in these documents, like “the main


40

00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,560

I understood”, the main content. Here
every word has meaning.


41

00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,840

Look here: “the dissertation must be written by the author independently.”


42

00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,400

Here an element of ethics already arises, and an element of such


43

00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,800

debatable and pretentious, you can already make a claim


44

00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,600

here to present for some dissertations.


45

00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:15,840

Further: “it must contain new
scientific results and provisions,


46

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,120

who come forward for public defense.”


47

00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:23,280

The novelty of scientific results and provisions is almost the most basic position.


48

00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,840

Further: “the dissertation must demonstrate personal contribution”,


49

00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,520

that is, independent and personal contribution, naturally


50

00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:36,600

these are related things, this is also an element of ethics and an element that may cause some claims


51

00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:40,400

to how the dissertation is defended and what is being defended.


52

00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,400

Now, it is absolutely obvious that it is impossible to write a dissertation without using sources.


53

00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,000

Moreover, they definitely must be, and a lot of them,


54

00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,040

they must demonstrate mastery of the dissertation


55

00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,600

the current state of research in the field of knowledge in which he works.


56

00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:59,240

But, as a rule, this refers to the overview chapter


57

00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:03,280

or overview paragraphs in each chapter if they are written that way.


58

00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,280

That is, it should be an overview of the current state of research,


59

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,600

review of modern techniques,


60

00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,880

if experimental or some sociological techniques are used.


61

00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:19,640

But, when a review of works is used and conducted (naturally, this is a review of the works of other authors),


62

00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:25,080

There must be links to the authors and the source of borrowings.


63

00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:28,840

Further. Very often, publications that reflect the main content


64

00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:33,120

the main materials of the dissertation, they were published in co-authorship.


65

00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,920

A rather subtle question arises here:


66

00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,480

What are the rights of each co-author to the material that is published?


67

00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,640

That is, is it possible, for example, the same scientific result,


68

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,200

published in the same article, used in several dissertations.


69

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,200

To avoid this problem,


70

00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,960

sometimes right in the article somewhere at the end it states the contents,


71

00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,600

that is, which of the co-authors contributed what to this article.


72

00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,280

For example, one prepared samples in experimental work,


73

00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,160

another carried out measurements, a third processed these measurements,


74

00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,320

the fourth was looking for some kind of chemical, physical, biological, sociological,


75

00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,560

the economic substance of these results, and so on.


76

00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,080

If this is not done, then, of course, the issue here is very delicate.


77

00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:24,160

And this question, unfortunately, quite often leads to conflict situations.


78

00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,080

We must try to avoid them.


79

00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:34,720

Now, here's what I was saying, it's partially stated here: the ethics of co-authorship.


80

00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,640

Now, I have just spoken about the division of scientific results.


81

00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:43,080

Unfortunately, this is not done often, but in general, I would like to recommend


82

00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,080

do this right at the entrance so that it is clearly written,


83

00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,560

and this must be written down in the text of the dissertation, without fail!


84

00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,800

If partially co-authored texts are used,


85

00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,480

generally speaking, all co-authors must agree


86

00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,480

to use these texts because it is a joint


87

00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:09,800

intellectual property and everyone, generally speaking, has equal rights.


88

00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,440

Very often, publications are published in collaboration with a scientific supervisor.


89

00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,600

In general, this is probably correct
because after all, it is the scientific director,


90

00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:25,480

as a rule, sets the topic of research, determines some basic positions,


91

00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:28,760

main milestones of this study, research methods.


92

00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:33,120

And I'm not even talking about other co-authors, especially in experimental studies,


93

00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,600

who do a lot - samples, installations, etc.


94

00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,400

And here, of course, you also have to understand every time,


95

00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:44,040

that the dissertation candidate uses materials from joint research,


96

00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,240

and therefore he must distinguish very clearly,


97

00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:52,240

what is his contribution, his own contribution, to this work.


98

00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:55,640

It is often said that the order of co-authors of a publication is important.


99

00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,360

This is a moot point.


100

00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,440

Generally speaking, there are no uniform guidelines.


101

00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,040

For example, there are large scientific teams in which co-authors are located simply


102

00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,880

in alphabetical order, according to the first letter of your last name,


103

00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,880

and sometimes, sometimes very often, for example,


104

00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:16,440

scientific supervisor of the entire team (this is very often present abroad),


105

00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,040

he is always listed as the last co-author.


106

00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,320

Sometimes the first co-author is listed as the person who made the main contribution to the article.


107

00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,360

But here, too, there are no mandatory, I would say, requirements,


108

00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:34,480

because very often it depends on what traditions have developed in the scientific team,


109

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,080

and if somewhere, someone, sometime insists on the fact that the dissertation author does not have a single publication,


110

00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,760

where he is the first co-author, then, actually,


111

00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,960

this cannot be a basis for reproach that he violated some ethical things


112

00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,520

or took away some other results. Of course not.


113

00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,640

Very often, when writing a dissertation text, employees


114

00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:59,320

people use materials that they have written before,


115

00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:03,080

pieces of your own text from your own scientific articles are used.


116

00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:07,720

If these are their own pieces, there is probably no crime here, this is probably


117

00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:11,520

you can do it, but it’s still better not to abuse it


118

00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:19,280

for the simple reason that now all dissertation texts are required to pass


119

00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,680

digital check for incorrect borrowings.


120

00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:27,360

And again, if publications have a large team;


121

00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:30,480

and some gratitude is expressed (best done in a dissertation


122

00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:36,480

also reflected in the abstract), there is nothing here that would cause


123

00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:39,480

unhealthy interest of others, well, the author is grateful to those


124

00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,560

who helped him in these studies.


125

00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:47,760

But it is important that all scientific novelty and scientific results belong to the author.


126

00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,040

Now regarding citing other people's works.


127

00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,600

There are several important aspects here. In particular, there must be a very precise quotation,


128

00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:00,000

so that it does not cause... so that incorrectness and inaccuracy


129

00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:05,000

did not raise any doubts that something, somewhere a person is trying to use


130

00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,600

some other people's data and at the same time confuses the traces, as they say.


131

00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,080

Again, in some sciences


132

00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:18,800

(for example, in literary criticism) one cannot do without extensive quotations from literary sources,


133

00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,680

but they must be clearly identified: they must be indicated by quotation marks,


134

00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,320

it must be clearly written - from which work,


135

00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,600

not just a work, but when it is published, it is a work.


136

00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,200

If it's a book, it may have several editions,


137

00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:37,360

that is, this bibliographic citation should be as accurate as possible.


138

00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,400

But you still need to understand that the entire dissertation


139

00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,160

cannot consist only of borrowed sources.


140

00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,320

Very often this, for example,


141

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,920

the work of people who use many experimental setups is faulty,


142

00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,760

because they describe experimental techniques.


143

00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,400

There are many experimental setups and techniques; these techniques are used from some


144

00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,120

there are enough standard descriptions and regulations, and they are half the dissertation, if not more,


145

00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,680

capable of borrowing. But this is not the point, of course, because the methods need to be described,


146

00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,720

but, in general, you can, as they say, partially use your own vision of these techniques.


147

00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:18,760

Secondly, if you spent more than half of your dissertation describing the methodology, then the question arises:


148

00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,560

and where then are your own scientific results, novelty?


149

00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:26,080

The most important thing is to emphasize the novelty.


150

00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:30,880

The novelty of scientific results is the most important thing, this is the thing


151

00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:36,640

which under no circumstances should give rise to doubt


152

00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,360

neither from expert councils, nor from expert groups,


153

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,080

neither from opponents, nor from members of dissertation councils.


154

00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:50,000

Now regarding borrowing and all these things,


155

00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,040

which I just talked about.


156

00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:59,040

For at least 10 years, maybe more, our country has had a mandatory rule:


157

00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,160

that all dissertations must pass a digital borrowing test, the so-called “Anti-plagiarism”.


158

00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:10,200

Although this is not necessarily “Anti-plagiarism”, there are different digital checking systems.


159

00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:13,440

At our university, for example, we use the Rucontext system.


160

00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,960

In general, by and large, this is the same thing.


161

00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,040

No, I said it wrong, it’s not the same thing, but it’s a very similar system.


162

00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:23,280

What are they checking?


163

00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:29,920

They check the Internet, all the literature that is posted on the Internet


164

00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,520

necessarily through the Network, they check through matches of blocks, directly blocks of texts,


165

00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:42,680

they provide information about the volume of borrowings, either in pages or as a percentage of text.


166

00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,880

Some systems can, generally speaking,


167

00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,720

and check these very relevant texts in a foreign language.


168

00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,680

For example, this is what one of the pictures looks like on the right:


169

00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:58,960

here's where, look, three are indicated: original fragments - 77%,


170

00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,433

citation – 14, borrowings detected.


171

00:12:02,433 --> 00:12:06,958

What is the difference between a citation and a detected borrowing?


172

00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:11,960

A citation is a piece of text that clearly states where it came from,


173

00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:16,160

from which work is this piece of text taken and should be clearly described


174

00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,440

the meaning of this quotation, why it is quoted.


175

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:26,040

If this is a literary source, then it is clear, it means that this is some kind of necessary content,


176

00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:31,960

if this is some kind of, I don’t know, wise phrase or some kind of conclusion from the work,


177

00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,720

some kind of physical, chemical or something else,


178

00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:39,120

The text should also describe what the purpose of using this quotation is.


179

00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,080

If this is a review of the novelty of scientific results,


180

00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,800

this means an overview of the current state of research,


181

00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,120

the so-called introductory overview chapter or overview paragraph,


182

00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:55,440

it should also clearly state that such and such authors conducted such and such a study,


183

00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,080

Here they showed such and such results,


184

00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:01,360

such and such samples were studied or something like that.


185

00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,800

In part, these systems are able to recognize attempts to bypass.


186

00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:15,760

As a participant, as a member of the Higher Attestation Commission, I have repeatedly participated


187

00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:23,400

in meetings of the Presidium of the Higher Attestation Commission dedicated to appeals made


188

00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:27,400

representatives of the Dissernet group regarding borrowings.


189

00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,000

The fact is that borrowings, for example, are of the following nature:


190

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,880

a large piece of text is taken and a contextual replacement is made in it,


191

00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,720

for example, somewhere, something agricultural, suppose


192

00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:45,920

where a livestock farm is replaced by a poultry farm


193

00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,560

(well, excuse me, it’s kind of a banal example, maybe).


194

00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,240

Everything else is the same, one word changes,


195

00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,560

one concept, and then the whole text, all the content is the same.


196

00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:59,520

Here are the modern “Atiplagiarism” systems, that’s what we’ll call them in quotes,


197

00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:03,480

Generally speaking, they also know how to distinguish such things.


198

00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,000

The most important thing here is the following:


199

00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,080

Of course, it is impossible to do without borrowings and citations.


200

00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:14,800

Borrowing is when you simply take some pieces of text that have already been published,


201

00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,400

and insert it into your work.


202

00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,560

Then the question arises: where, from what sources are they taken?


203

00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,560

Anti-plagiarism systems and digital verification systems can recognize these sources


204

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:31,000

and they just give out a huge list of these same sources,


205

00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,280

where did the pieces of text included in the dissertation come from?


206

00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:36,720

So, it’s very important here what these pieces are,


207

00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,960

because usually (very often) these pieces appear


208

00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:45,560

from their own articles, from their own reviews, preprints,


209

00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,560

reports that were published somewhere earlier and ended up on the Internet.


210

00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,320

But if they belong to the author or were made with the participation of the author,


211

00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,840

this is one song, there is one attitude towards it, and if these are completely alien pieces,


212

00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,040

and, God forbid, these alien pieces are inserted there,


213

00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,440

where there is a description of scientific results and scientific conclusions, this is the reason for


214

00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:10,600

so that this work comes under investigation as to whether there is any scientific novelty in it,


215

00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:17,840

But is it an independent work like I showed on the very first slide,


216

00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:23,440

Is there a personal contribution from the author here, or is this all done at his order by someone there?


217

00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,280

from somewhere there using the example of his own research.


218

00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:31,640

All this must be avoided.


219

00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:36,720

And Ural Federal University,
and his dissertation committees use


220

00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,480

all these methods and, generally speaking, check all these works, trusting, of course,


221

00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,120

to our dissertation councils.


222

00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:48,600

And so that the dissertation author does not have any problems in


223

00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,800

that there are doubts about scientific novelty, about personal contribution,


224

00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,920

You should try to write your dissertation as independently as possible.


225

00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,600

It is necessary that the scientific results there be new.


226

00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,840

Nobody requires a Ph.D. dissertation.


227

00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:06,280

level of scientific results at the level of the Nobel Prize, but they are still


228

00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:10,000

must be new, interesting and important.


229

00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,200

Good luck to you all, goodbye, thank you!
