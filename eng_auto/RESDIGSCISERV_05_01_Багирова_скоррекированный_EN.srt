00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:03,520
Hello, dear graduate students.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,920
My name is Anna Petrovna Bagirova.

3
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,920
I am a professor, doctor of economics
and candidate of sociological sciences

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,840
and occupy an administrative position of
Deputy Director for Science

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,200
Institute of Economics and Management and
School of Government Management

6
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,080
and entrepreneurship of the Ural
Federal University.

7
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:33,800
Today we will talk about
an important topic for every graduate student

8
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,800
publication activity and journal selection

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,800
to present results
of their dissertation research.

10
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,480
The first part of this topic is related to publications
from the List of the Higher Attestation Commission,

11
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:58,560
which exists under the Ministry of Science
and higher education of the Russian Federation.

12
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,569
Issues of choosing publications
platforms for presenting results

13
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,360
of a dissertation research is regulated

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:13,000
by "Regulations on awarding scientists
degrees" at our university.

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,920
If your defense is planned in
some other university

16
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,960
which acts independently
the right to award academic degrees,

17
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:28,560
then you need to familiarize yourself with
their local regulations.

18
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,520
If your defense is planned
in the dissertation council,

19
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,560
existing under the Higher Attestation Commission

20
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,600
in a university without independent right
to award degrees,

21
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,600
then, accordingly, you need to
read the document,

22
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,960
which is called "Regulations
on the awarding of academic degrees"

23
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600
by the Ministry of Science and Higher
education of the Russian Federation.

24
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,800
Our "Regulations on the awarding of academic degrees"

25
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,280
provides the following important points.

26
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,480
Firstly, it states that
the main scientific results should be

27
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,360
published in publications of a certain level.

28
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,480
These are peer-reviewed scientific publications
and/or peer-reviewed scientific publications,

29
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:25,240
included in international abstracts
databases and citation systems.

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:33,320
Secondly (and here there is a significant connection with
ministry regulations), it states that

31
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:39,680
the requirements for these peer-reviewed publications
and the rules for forming their list are established

32
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,400
by Ministry of Science and Higher
education of the Russian Federation.

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,760
This is very important because it means

34
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,920
that you as graduate students who are most likely
will defend themselves in dissertation councils,

35
00:02:54,920 --> 00:03:01,120
operating at the Ural Federal University,
should first of all pay attention

36
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,360
to the list of the Higher Attestation Commission, to the list,
which is published by

37
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:09,480
Ministry of Science and Higher
education of the Russian Federation.

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,080
And the third point, which regulates
number of publications required

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,080
To submit your dissertation for defense:

40
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,680
today the number of these publications is
at least three for both the subjects

41
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:33,560
of humanities, social sciences and

42
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:40,840
natural and technical sciences, while
there must be at least one publication

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:48,360
in a publication included in international
abstract databases and citation systems.

44
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,320
I repeat that this is the Regulation
valid today. Follow all the changes

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:57,480
(and they can even happen
soon)

46
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,760
yourself as a graduate student to ensure that

47
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:05,760
you don't end up
working on a dissertation

48
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,560
with some unfulfilled set of
requirements for publication activity.

49
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,660
The next important question is
(it worries graduate students a lot)

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:22,040
where the main scientific results should be
published,

51
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,120
and where can I get it and see it?
Here is the current list.

52
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,000
We have already said that the list
peer-reviewed scientific publications

53
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,680
compiled by the Higher Attestation Commission

54
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,000
Ministry of Science and Higher
education of the Russian Federation.

55
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,040
Secondly, this list is linked
to scientific specialties.

56
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:52,080
And here many questions arise,
if you suddenly change a scientific specialty

57
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:58,240
during your graduate studies
or at their end.

58
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:05,040
And one more important point is that
this list is constantly updated.

59
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,320
Accordingly, at any given time
you need to understand

60
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,480
where to find 
current version of this list,

61
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:21,720
and what specialty is that journal associated with,
in which you plan to publish.

62
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:29,600
We'll look at this clearly at the
website of the Higher Attestation Commission.

63
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,640
Now we will go to the site
Higher Attestation Commission


64
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:39,840
and see where to find the current lists of publications
included by the Higher Attestation Commission.


65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:49,880
It's located here in the tab
"Documents", and then "Reviewed publications".

66
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,880
The list is opened. Here you see
several lists,

67
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,000
we only need the latest, most relevant one.

68
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,040
Now I see that the most relevant one is
this is as of December 19, 2023.

69
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:08,400
And if we go into this
list, then we'll just see

70
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:16,360
that, firstly, it is huge,
1235 pages in this document alone

71
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:21,080
and, accordingly, about 3,000 sources.

72
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:30,840
And the second thing we see is that this list
contains publications in the context of scientific specialties.

73
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,240
It is important for you to pay attention to

74
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:41,640
from what time these specialties
have begun to relate to this magazine,

75
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:49,240
that is, we always choose
latest date match.

76
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:58,320
It is also important that these specialties,
their association with journals changes periodically.

77
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:02,920
For example, let's take a specific journal

78
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:08,520
and let's see how it goes when
Scientific specialties change.

79
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:23,400
Let's look at the journal "Management Issues".

80
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:36,240
Here it is shown what publications does it accept today
in the context of three scientific specialties.

81
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Among these, three are economic specialties,
This is "Economic Theory"

82
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,200
"Regional and industry
Economics" and "Management"

83
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:46,840
and one specialty in sociology -

84
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:51,680
"Social structure,
social institutions and processes."

85
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:59,320
If we look at the List
publications of the Higher Attestation Commission for earlier years,

86
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:08,240
for example, not on December 19, 2023,
and at the end of December 2020

87
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:15,200
and let's see what were there
specialties of this journal,

88
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:20,560
then we see that the set of
specialties is completely different.

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:26,200
There are only two economic specialties here,
one specialty is sociology,

90
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:33,720
and completely different than now, and
one in political science.

91
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:45,400
If we turn to the same journal,
but in the 2018 List, we will see

92
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:51,720
that this list did not contain any
connection to scientific specialties,

93
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,840
only to branches of science.

94
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:04,440
Accordingly, if your article in this journal
was published in 2018, then it

95
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,720
will be counted as an article,
meeting today's requirements

96
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,880
when you submit a dissertation for defense


97
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:24,520
If your article was published in this
joural in 2020, then it will be credited to you

98
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:28,200
as a publication result only if

99
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,640
you are defending thesis by one
of these four specialties

100
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:39,720
or in those new specialties,
which they moved to.

101
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:43,160
If you are defending thesis and have published

102
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,760
in this magazine in 2023, then, accordingly,

103
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:52,320
you need to be guided by the 2023 year list
and that set of specialties,

104
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:59,160
which are currently in this magazine.

105
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,800
So it makes the transition
from specialty to specialty difficult,

106
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:12,200
because when changing specialty
it is necessary to revise completely those publications

107
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,840
in which your scientific results
have been published,

108
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:24,960
and it may turn out that the publications you have
will not be enough to obtain a degree.

109
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,440
Recently, all the journals

110
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:35,360
that belong to the List of Higher Attestation Commissions,
have been classified into three categories.

111
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,840
This has happened in December 2022
when the Higher Attestation Commission first announced

112
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:47,960
the upcoming changes to regulations
in the field of state scientific certification,

113
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:51,240
related to the categorization of journals.

114
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:55,040
Accordingly, today the list

115
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,880
of the Higher Attestation Commission
is divided into three categories,

116
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,320
and it looks something like this:
as shown in this slide.

117
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,800
Next to each journal name
its category is indicated.

118
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,840
Accordingly, the first category is for
the journals of the highest level.

119
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:21,040
And the third category consists of
lower level journals.

120
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,920
We are now awaiting new criteria
for applicants for academic degrees,

121
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,920
where this categorization of journals
will be taken into account.

122
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:38,440
That is, these will be the criteria
who will set the

123
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:46,080
minimum threshold requirements for publication
activity of graduate students coming to the defense.

124
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:50,840
But now we can say
that the higher the level

125
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:57,560
and the higher the category of journals, in
which your work was published:


126
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,560
your scientific results,
presented in the dissertation,

127
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,680
the more chances you have to defend
your work on the dissertation committee.

128
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:14,040
Now I'm on the website of the Higher Attestation Commission
I will demonstrate

129
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:21,720
where you can find the categorization of the
journals included in the list of Higher Attestation Commissions.

130
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,120
Most recently on the site of the
Higher Attestation Commission

131
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:32,240
the final journals distribution has appeared
the List of Higher Attestation Commission in three categories.


132
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,280
It can be found here in "Documents" section,

133
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:40,960
Next we go to "Reviewed Editions" and "Final
distribution of journals on the List of Higher Attestation Commission".

134
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:46,640
You see that all the journals
here they are evenly separated by colors,

135
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,080
first category journals come first,

136
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:58,840
then the journals of the second category
and the third category.

137
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:06,200
Total about 3,000 publications
are classified.

138
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:16,120
In addition, on the HAC website today there is
information about what categories of publications

139
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:22,120
are assigned to journals
indexed in Web of Science and Scopus

140
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:27,240
and other foreign specialized
scientific citation databases.

141
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,640
This document can be used right now.
And please note that in this document

142
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:42,820
nothing is said about conference proceedings,
which are indexed in Web of Science and Scopus.

143
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:46,040
According to modern relevant documents

144
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:54,040
these publications are not equivalent
to categories K1, K2 or K3.

145
00:13:54,040 --> 00:14:01,360
What scientific results are the main ones?
which should be published in journals

146
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,920
from the List of Higher Attestation
Commission or others equivalent to them?

147
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:13,360
These are, of course, the provisions
which are being defended

148
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,680
as a result of your dissertation work.

149
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:26,080
It's better to plan all this in advance, at the stage
when you are just starting work on your dissertation,

150
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:33,320
it's good to have such a preliminary
project of your scientific results.

151
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,400
Of course, without a scientific supervisor
you can't plan it,

152
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:41,680
but the first scientific result, for example, is desirable,

153
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,720
to be published in
one publication of the Higher Attestation Commission,

154
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:50,000
the second result - in another and the third - in the third.

155
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:54,560
We know that today's minimum of
publications is three

156
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:02,480
This is the minimum threshold for publication activity
for a graduate student defending his dissertation.

157
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:07,600
This publication activity plan
maybe more detailed

158
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,120
it can be discussed with your supervisor

159
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,320
literally at one of the first meetings,
when you are just creating a table of contents,

160
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,080
this is the plan for your dissertation
research, and it may already be laid there,

161
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:29,400
that some result stated
in the form of one paragraph or another,

162
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:36,600
will result in this or that article in journals
from the List of the Higher Attestation Commission.

163
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:44,523
The plan may, of course, be
detailed with time,

164
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:44,600
that is, years can be indicated there at once,

165
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:52,640
months of even submitting your texts,
your manuscripts to the editors of these journals.

166
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:55,080
This tighter planning

167
00:15:55,080 --> 00:16:02,560
actually makes the work of a graduate student easier,
allows you to better control this work,

168
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:09,640
adjust it somehow
and pass certification for graduate students,

169
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:17,080
which, as you know, periodically
included in your curriculum.

170
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:25,640
So to sum up the
review of publication activity

171
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:31,520
in journals from the Higher Attestation Commission List, one can
give some recommendations for you

172
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:35,400
on preparing manuscripts for publications from this List.

173
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:39,240
The first and very important thing is that

174
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:45,400
what needs to be checked regularly
check the current List of journals

175
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:50,440
Higher Attestation Commission
before sending the manuscript,

176
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:56,360
because this list is constantly
changing, we already told about this today.

177
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:03,480
Secondly, it is necessary to monitor changes in
regulatory documentation - these are also local acts

178
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:10,440
of Ural Federal University, and
acts of a higher level, in particular

179
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:15,040
Ministry of Science and Higher
education, because, as we know,

180
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:22,920
they regulate what is necessary
number of publications and their level.

181
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:28,400
Third, you need to choose carefully,
be very careful when choosing a journal

182
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:33,960
taking into account, of course, the recommendations
from your scientific supervisor,

183
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,360
but also taking into account the categorization of journals.

184
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:45,360
Four, you need to comply clearly with the
requirements for the structure and design of the text,

185
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,640
take into account the deadlines for reviewing manuscripts in publications

186
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,880
(and they can be very large,
up to a year or more).

187
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:00,800
And it is important to consider issues of co-authorship
so that this publishing activity of yours

188
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:06,680
was indeed recognized for
submitting your dissertation for defense.

189
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:13,640
This will be discussed in more detail
in a special topic in our course.
