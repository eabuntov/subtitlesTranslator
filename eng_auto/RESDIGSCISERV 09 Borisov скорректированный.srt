00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,880

My name is Vasily Borisov,


2

00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,960

I am the director of master's programs


3

00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:08,240

“Applied Artificial Intelligence” and “Machine Learning Engineering”,


4

00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:13,040

and I'll tell you
about artificial intelligence for science.


5

00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,200

Artificial intelligence is a field of computer science


6

00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,160

which is engaged in the creation of programs and systems capable of performing tasks,


7

00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,040

which usually require human intellectual abilities.


8

00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:28,120

These tasks may include pattern recognition,


9

00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:32,360

natural language processing, planning and decision making.


10

00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:37,240

Artificial intelligence uses methods of machine learning, deep learning,


11

00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:42,520

neural networks and other technologies for data analysis and model creation,


12

00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,120

which can imitate human thinking.


13

00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,200

The term "artificial intelligence" was coined by John McCarthy


14

00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160

at the Dartmouth Conference back in 1956.


15

00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:57,320

Development of artificial intelligence over the past 70 years


16

00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,160

can be divided into several stages.


17

00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,080

At the first stages, systems were created
using logical databases and rules.


18

00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,240

The second stage began with the advent of machine learning,


19

00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,880

At this stage, algorithms were developed


20

00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,840

allowing computers to learn from experience and make predictions.


21

00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,440

This was followed by the stage of development of deep learning and neural networks,


22

00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,840

At this stage, deep learning models were created.


23

00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,360

History of the emergence of large language models


24

00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,440

begins with the development of simpler models in the 80s and 90s.


25

00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:40,040

However, a real breakthrough in this area
occurred in the late 2010s with the advent of technology


26

00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,706

generative pre-trained transformers - such as neural language models,


27

00:01:40,706 --> 00:01:51,000

which are trained on large datasets to generate human-like text.


28

00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,600

Currently, the ongoing development and improvement of artificial


29

00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,880

intelligence includes deep learning,


30

00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,200

natural language processing and computer vision.


31

00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,160

There are two types of artificial intelligence:


32

00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,160

strong (or general) and weak (or specialized).


33

00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,000

Examples of weak artificial intelligence are smart home technologies,


34

00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,400

online translators, image recognition systems, and so on.


35

00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:23,040

Weak artificial intelligence is capable of solving only those tasks for which it was created and trained.


36

00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,520

For example, a chess program can only play chess.


37

00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,440

What distinguishes strong artificial intelligence from weak artificial intelligence is its ability to decide


38

00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,560

various tasks, rather than highly specialized ones.


39

00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,280

At the moment there is no strong artificial intelligence,


40

00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,840

which would be capable of solving a wide range of problems.


41

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:46,040

Scientists and experts argue about the possibilities and timing of creating artificial intelligence,


42

00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:50,560

representing the integration of already created artificial intelligence systems


43

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,200

into a single system capable
solve humanity's problems.


44

00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,120

Rapid development of artificial intelligence technologies


45

00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,520

requires control by society and the state.


46

00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,480

The Alliance in Artificial Intelligence brings together leading research centers


47

00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,600

and technology companies in Russia in order to develop their competencies


48

00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,120

and accelerated implementation of artificial intelligence


49

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,680

in education, research and practical business activities.


50

00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,080

The main task of the Alliance is to provide technological


51

00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,680

leadership of our country in the global high-tech market.


52

00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,160

The use of artificial intelligence in science and industry is developing dynamically


53

00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,640

and covers all new areas of human life.


54

00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,040

This rapid spread of technology causes concern among citizens,


55

00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,160

how safe is artificial intelligence for humans,


56

00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,720

in which areas it is permissible to use it,


57

00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,360

who will be responsible for the actions of artificial intelligence, etc.


58

00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:56,160

Large language models can be used for scientific purposes to solve various problems.


59

00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:00,600

For example, they can be used
for processing large volumes of text data -


60

00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:04,720

such as analysis of scientific articles, patents or medical records.


61

00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,400

They can also help in sentiment analysis of the text,


62

00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:12,960

identifying keywords and phrases, as well as identifying plagiarism.


63

00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:20,120

The model in its work receives a “prompt” as input - this is a request from the user or a set of keywords,


64

00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,480

and then selects the most suitable next word,


65

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,360

after that, the resulting string is again fed to the input of the model,


66

00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,400

and she selects another word.


67

00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,760

Using prompts to write texts allows graduate students to better


68

00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,880

understand the unique challenges associated with writing scientific papers,


69

00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,880

and develop the skills necessary to work effectively in this field.


70

00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:48,400

It should be noted, however,


71

00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,680

that one should always use the most modern and advanced technologies available


72

00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,400

for you the moment you use them.


73

00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,520

There are many different types of prompts,


74

00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,880

which can be applied regardless of which language model you are using.


75

00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,800

The basic principle is to always start a query with an action verb, for example, “come up with options”


76

00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,440

“write”, “analyze” and so on.


77

00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:22,240

Clearly formulate the end goal - the type of content, for example, an analytical article,


78

00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,400

description of the schedule or email and subject matter.


79

00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:29,520

You can create complex three-step tasks,


80

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,840

including collecting information, summarizing and creating a final answer.


81

00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:39,840

You can also specify the length of the text (for example, from 400 to 800 characters).


82

00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,600

If you don't want to go into detail,
you can simply write: short or long text.


83

00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,880

There are several types of scientific tasks that can be automated


84

00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,920

using artificial intelligence. For example, classification of articles.


85

00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,520

Artificial intelligence can categorize articles


86

00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,120

according to various categories such as topic, type of study, year of publication, and so on.


87

00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,000

Text analysis: artificial intelligence can analyze the text of an article,


88

00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,040

identifying key words, phrases and ideas and their relationships.


89

00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:15,760

Identification of authors: artificial intelligence can determine the authors of an article,


90

00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:19,200

by comparing their writing style to other authors in the database.


91

00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,760

Article quality assessment: artificial intelligence can evaluate the quality of the article itself,


92

00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:28,080

analyzing its structure, research quality and results.


93

00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,320

You can see the main action verbs on the slide


94

00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:38,520

and try to use them in working with large language models.


95

00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,440

Basic principles for creating effective prompts


96

00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:45,320

for artificial intelligence systems include the following aspects.


97

00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,600

The first is precision and clarity: requests must be formulated


98

00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:52,400

so clear and precise that the system can understand what exactly is required.


99

00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,840

The second is specificity:


100

00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:59,360

requests must be specific and specific to a particular task or situation.


101

00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,000

Third, grammatical correctness:


102

00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,600

queries must be grammatically correct,


103

00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,680

so that the artificial intelligence system can interpret them correctly.


104

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,440

Understandability: queries must be understandable to the artificial intelligence system,


105

00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,640

so she can find the information she needs or complete a task.


106

00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:18,280

Optimization:
queries must be optimized


107

00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:24,120

to achieve the best results,
for example, for better efficiency or performance.


108

00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,840

And finally, saving resources.


109

00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,640

Text generated using artificial intelligence technology


110

00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:36,160

can be easily detected using special tools.


111

00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,600

Public text detection services,


112

00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,280

generated using large language models are presented on the slide.


113

00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,960

But they are also developing rapidly and new ones are appearing.


114

00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:54,240

Academic integrity requires acting ethically and responsibly in the learning process.


115

00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,440

and preparation of scientific texts.


116

00:07:56,440 --> 00:08:01,160

It should be remembered that the use of artificial intelligence tools for plagiarism


117

00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:06,560

Forgery, cheating in exams or research will not be tolerated.


118

00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:10,640

Using large language models provides a convenient mechanism


119

00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,320

for working with large amounts of information.


120

00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,680

But it is worth emphasizing that the use


121

00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,960

such tools have only an auxiliary function


122

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,760

and eases the graduate student’s path in preparing their dissertation.


123

00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,920

On the other hand, one should not hope


124

00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:30,400

that the use of state-of-the-art methods will replace you and your dissertation work.


125

00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,360

The author and only the author is responsible for the final result,


126

00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,040

since the use of artificial intelligence technology


127

00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,200

when writing text can be easily calculated using special methods.


128

00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640

Thank you for your attention.
