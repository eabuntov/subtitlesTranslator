00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:01,560
Good afternoon, dear colleagues.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,080
Today we will talk about expert methods of assessment of a scientist's scientific performance.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:10,880
When may we need an expert assessment?

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,480
For example, when applying for a job, when applying for a grant project

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,800
or when assessing the performance of a whole structural unit or a small scientific group.

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:27,000
As an example, let's consider the procedure of expert assessment by the Russian Science Foundation,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,920
which occurs when we submit an application for examination.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:37,080
The procedure is complex and expensive, consists of several stages,

9
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:41,880
and to carry out such an examination it is necessary at the first stage

10
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:49,280
to form a pool of experts in subject areas that corresponds to the grant application.

11
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,200
After this there is a formal check

12
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,880
based on characteristics from the competition documentation.

13
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,840
Next, an individual examination takes place,

14
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:05,520
which involves two to five experts per application.

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:12,560
Each expert writes a resume according of application assessment and fills in the questionnaire.

16
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,880
Applications are then reviewed at a meeting of the expert council section

17
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,560
by scientific areas.

18
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,600
Then applications are selected by expert councils,

19
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:28,240
are considered at a general meeting of the foundation expert council.

20
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,160
This is a big job, time-consuming, which requires

21
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,960
attracting various scientometric tools.

22
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,760
What means can help in an expert assessment?

23
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Traditionally in this kind of procedures, the Hirsch index is used.

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:50,760
This is the number h, the maximum number h,

25
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:54,880
where the author publishes at least h articles,

26
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:58,600
and each of them is cited at least h times.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:07,320
You can determine the h-factor or Hirsch index according to the graph shown in the slide.

28
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,062
This indicator is useful because at the same time it displays publication activity,

29
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:16,360
and the scientific authority of the author,which we are considering.

30
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,920
However, it has few drawbacks.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,520
It is impossible to show various aspects of a scientists activity in one number.

32
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:30,782
This indicator is more profitable for experienced researchers

33
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:34,360
with a lot of publications and scientific work experience,

34
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:39,160
H-factor doesn't really suitable for comparing disciplines

35
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,280
with different average levels of citations.

36
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:49,120
Also for young researchers, for graduate students, the h-factor figure doesn't say much,

37
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,080
since their publications have not yet got enough citations,

38
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:59,760
It is recommended to young scientists to turn attention, in fact, to the publication process,

39
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,400
and the H-index will increase over time.

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:09,200
Also, the Hirsch index does not reflect the dynamics of a scientific work,

41
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,040
and if at some point in time the scientist stopped working in science,

42
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,520
then his H-index will remain as high or as low

43
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:22,080
as it was during the process of his work.

44
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,640
For proper accounting of scientific activities we need to carry out normalization,

45
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:35,440
in particular, comparing the number of citations in various fields of science.

46
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,400
As you can see from the picture on the right, for different subject areas

47
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:46,440
such as agriculture, biology, education, chemistry, physics,

48
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,200
completely different ratios of the number of published works to

49
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,960
average number of references are characteristic. The tendency to cite older works,

50
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:03,720
original works or fresh ones, came in recent years also varies.

51
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:08,280
For normalization, it is common to use percentiles.

52
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:14,160
Percentile is calculated based on type of publication, that is, for one type of publications

53
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:19,160
in the same subject category

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:26,200
and for works published in the same years as the work in question.

55
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,160
In the right graph you can see citation count curve

56
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:37,320
for articles in the field of inorganic chemistry, published in 2015.

57
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,680
A large number of works have small number of citations,

58
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:48,240
and a small number of works have a number of citations up to 430.

59
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,640
The number of citations is shown on the left axis.

60
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,960
On the right axis the percentile is shown, in which certain works fall into.

61
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,840
For example, if you received 30 citations per publication,

62
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:07,800
then your article falls into the 89th percentile by citation,

63
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:13,200
if we received 10 citations on publication - we fall into the 52nd percentile,

64
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:18,600
that is, 48% of publications have as many or more citations.

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,040
An indicator such as percentile allows taking into account the subject area of these publications,

66
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,628
thus allowing you to get rid of some shortcomings of the Hirsch index.

67
00:05:30,628 --> 00:05:33,880
For a more adequate assessment of individual activities of scientists

68
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:38,880
Clarivate proposed a new type of diagram, which is called Beamplot.

69
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,240
It places the researcher's publications in context

70
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,200
and allows comparing and evaluating citations of his works by year.

71
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:52,680
This approach allows you to avoid reducing the results to one metric,

72
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,560
and based on the graph shown in the right picture,

73
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,080
you can think and discuss

74
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,080
why do a scientist citations look the way they look.

75
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,200
The vertical axis in the graph reflects date of publication, namely the year of publication.

76
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,480
The horizontal axis shows citation percentile,

77
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,760
and for each year individual publications are displayed by dots.

78
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:26,400
The dotted line shows median citation value,

79
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:32,920
that is, the citation percentile that is typical for all publications of the author.

80
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,240
The positive side of this schedule is taking into account the dynamics of publication activity.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,360
For example, in the above graph we see,

82
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:49,360
that in 2014 the citation number of author's work was lower than in other years.

83
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,400
This chart is very helpful in solving a multiparameter problem

84
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:00,960
by choosing the best specialist for that or this position, one or another task.

85
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,640
For example, here is a table with the performance of four researchers

86
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,360
in the field of inorganic chemistry,

87
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,720
A, B, C and D - they all have different numbers of citations,

88
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,240
publications, h-index, average percentile and so on.

89
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:22,280
Naturally, the choice of the best one depends from the problem we are solving.

90
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,280
However, for a correct assessment one should look to

91
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:32,040
not just the numbers in the table, but also the Beamplot chart.

92
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,120
In particular, if we look simply into numbers, then for researcher A

93
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,520
we have the largest percentage of international works,

94
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,400
we have the highest h-index

95
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,760
and his other indicators are also at the level of other researchers.

96
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:53,080
However, taking into account the dynamics of publication activity

97
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,720
you can identify gaps in his career

98
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,400
or that he completed his scientific career in certain year.

99
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,440
As an example for researchers C and D are Beamplot charts,

100
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:14,600
on the basis of which it is possible to see that in 2014-2016

101
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:24,000
citations of researcher D on average was lower, than the citation rate of the works of scientist C,

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:29,680
however, the number of these works may be the same.

103
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,080
Based on the discussion, which necessarily one should carry out based on the results of constructing Beamplot,

104
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,240
you can select the optimal candidates for employment, for issuing a grant,

105
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:48,880
to perform a specific scientific task.

106
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,040
Where to find and how to build Beamplot?

107
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:58,680
The original version of Beamplot was proposedby Clarivate, integrated into Web of Science,

108
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,600
if you log into the system, you can find among researchers your own or someone else's surname,

109
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:14,280
press the search button, go to the list of researchers and go to your profile.

110
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:20,600
In particular, here in the first line my researcher profile is shown,

111
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:25,280
and on this personal page in the right column below

112
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:32,480
we can see a shortened Beamplot version for the entire history of the scientists work.

113
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,120
The minimum number of citations is shown there, maximum number of citations, percentile

114
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,880
and the median value as a green circle.

115
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,640
But when you click on the link, which is shown by the arrow,

116
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,440
we can move on to a more complete view

117
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,880
and look at the publications of a scientist over the past 10 years

118
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,080
or even throughout his entire career since the 1980s.

119
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:06,480
So we can look at citation of the scientists works

120
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,200
and the number of these works indexed in Web of Science database for various years,

121
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:18,600
make one decision or another based on such expert assessment.

122
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,000
What to do if we dont have access to Web of Science

123
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,880
and we can't build the plot automatically?

124
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,960
In this case we have free alternatives.

125
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:36,160
For example, in the R language a special library BibPlots was developed,

126
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,680
which includes the beamlot function, based on Web of Science-based data,

127
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:49,080
or on other databases, allows to generate a Beamplot chart.

128
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,280
Alternatively, if you have programming skills,

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:59,160
then using Python and Matplotlib library you can build such a graph yourself,

130
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:05,120
however, here you have to write a lot of code manually.

131
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,960
Thank you for your attention.
