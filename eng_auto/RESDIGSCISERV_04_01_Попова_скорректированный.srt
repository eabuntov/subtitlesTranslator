00:00:00,739 --> 00:00:02,919

Hello, dear
listeners.


2

00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:05,990

Today we'll talk
with you about


3

00:00:05,990 --> 00:00:09,210

what a variety of shapes
can accept


4

00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:12,970

in modern communication
scientific knowledge,


5

00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:16,059

namely we will talk
about types of scientific articles.


6

00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:20,080

In general, the production system
scientific knowledge


7

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,160

- this is a complex multidimensional
and a multifactorial process,


8

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,060

in which they take part
not only scientists or research teams,


9

00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:33,130

but also members of the wider public:


10

00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,649

states, business, industry and so on.


11

00:00:38,649 --> 00:00:42,200

What role does it play in this?
Science Magazine?


12

00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,170

As can be seen in the presented
picture,


13

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:49,579

scientific journal can be imagined
yourself with some kind of knot,


14

00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:53,460

in the process of not only generation,
but also distribution


15

00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,820

scientific knowledge among all
participants in this process.


16

00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,739

Let's look at, let's say
So,


17

00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:03,050

atomic level of this
process,


18

00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:05,700

namely, a scientific article.


19

00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,450

According to the definition, scientific
article


20

00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,170

- this is a work of authorship,
published in a scientific journal


21

00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:15,170

and describing the results


22

00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:19,260

conducted research
using scientific methods.


23

00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:21,540

Here I would like to draw
attention


24

00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,909

on two very important points.


25

00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,460

Firstly, this is copyright
work,


26

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,850

that is, every scientific
articles


27

00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:33,369

there must be one authors
or several people.


28

00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:36,829

Lately they've turned around
discussions:


29

00:01:36,829 --> 00:01:38,790

Can it be considered artificial?
intelligence


30

00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:43,470

co-author of a scientific article?
And a consensus has already been reached:


31

00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:46,350

no, the authors can be
only people


32

00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:49,619

which have and are determined
identity


33

00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:53,110

and place of work, or is it
called affiliation.


34

00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,960

In addition, scientific research
there must be


35

00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,079

carried out using
scientific methods.


36

00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,540

Are you already aware of philosophy?
studied or perhaps


37

00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,270

you will study the principles
scientific method of cognition,


38

00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,420

but here I will only mention
that any scientific knowledge


39

00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,040

should match
criteria


40

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,510

reproducibility
and evidence.


41

00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,250

Scientific article performs
essential functions


42

00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,569

in the modern system.


43

00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:27,300

Firstly, it is in the scientific
magazine


44

00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:31,400

through the prism of a scientific article
generally just information


45

00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:36,090

or is the data simply refracted?
and become scientific knowledge


46

00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,530

through a certain
procedures,


47

00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,769

which is called peer review.


48

00:02:40,769 --> 00:02:45,430

This is an expert opinion
colleagues in this field.


49

00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,019

Moreover, scientific knowledge
acquires


50

00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:51,530

specific form via
that's how it will be


51

00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,569

look on the pages
magazine.


52

00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:57,010

And today we'll talk
about types of scientific articles.


53

00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:00,269

Through scientific articles
and scientific journals


54

00:03:00,269 --> 00:03:04,410

there is a process of accumulation
scientific knowledge,


55

00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,160

as we all stand
so called,


56

00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:11,780

on the shoulders of giants when
each subsequent knowledge


57

00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:18,150

develops on the basis
already previous achievements, previous scientists.


58

00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:22,850

Through a scientific article it is carried out
cycle,


59

00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:25,569

when scientific knowledge spreads
Worldwide,


60

00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:28,629

and anyone can
find such an article.


61

00:03:28,629 --> 00:03:32,420

And finally, we must not forget
and about such an important function,


62

00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,650

as an attribution of scientific
knowledge, authorship,


63

00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:40,189

because scientists need
prioritize your achievements,


64

00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:43,470

and it happens
namely through publication.


65

00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:47,680

Therefore we can summarize
and say,


66

00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,260

what is a scientific article anyway?
must correspond


67

00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:53,829

the following most important criteria.


68

00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:57,340

First, in a scientific article
there must be novelty


69

00:03:57,340 --> 00:04:00,930

that is, the knowledge that
made available to the public


70

00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:04,420

must be reported in this
work for the first time


71

00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:09,489

and wear very important
significant methodological character.


72

00:04:09,489 --> 00:04:12,129

In addition, scientists should
use


73

00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:18,910

namely the scientific method of cognition -
this is experience, theorizing, building models.


74

00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,530

Finally, no review
it will just be information


75

00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:26,110

but by no means scientific
article.


76

00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:32,490

And finally - and this is very important
for our discussion today -


77

00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,539

scientific work is being written
in a scientific style of speech,


78

00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,930

which is characterized
the presence of special terminology,


79

00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:43,840

sequence
and logic of presentation


80

00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:46,320

and also the severity of style.


81

00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,150

Currently already established
three main types of scientific articles:


82

00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:56,699

this is original research
article,


83

00:04:56,699 --> 00:05:01,290

so-called original research
paper or article,


84

00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,360

review article
or paper


85

00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:07,840

and finally short messages
or short communications.


86

00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,440

In English here
these two words article and paper -


87

00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:18,040

they are practically interchangeable,
and it depends on the style of the magazine,


88

00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:20,479

from the tastes of the editors, like
call


89

00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,740

article in this particular
magazine.


90

00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:28,009

But it is important to note that everything
these are the three types of articles


91

00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:33,139

found in the form of rubrics
international scientific information databases


92

00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:35,520

and national databases (such as
as RSCI, RSCI),


93

00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,880

and international (Scopus or
Web of Science).


94

00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:42,220

If you open any
from these databases,


95

00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:45,389

you will see this important
category:


96

00:05:45,389 --> 00:05:52,009

origin research paper, review paper
or short messages.


97

00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:56,710

Let's take a closer look
let's look at each of these types


98

00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:57,710

and their characteristic features.


99

00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:02,509

And we will begin, of course,
from original research article,


100

00:06:02,509 --> 00:06:06,700

because she is the one
today, let's say


101

00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,180

currency of scientific communication,


102

00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:15,830

they should be the majority
every self-respecting scientist has


103

00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,720

that is, of course, review articles,
and short messages.


104

00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:24,090

But it is precisely in the track record
more products produced


105

00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,540

- these are the original ones
articles.


106

00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,060

This is the first performance
results to the scientific community,


107

00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,240

so just for this
type of articles


108

00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,840

The criteria for plagiarism are very
strict.


109

00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,530

And when they ask: “How much
Is it possible to plagiarize - 20 or 30%?”,


110

00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:44,470

doesn't really work here
talking about percentages


111

00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:46,610

because borrowing,
their number


112

00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:49,410

should tend to zero
Ideally.


113

00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:53,289

Moreover, in the original
research articles


114

00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:56,449

must be present
clear consistent


115

00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,940

and a clear description of the methodology
research,


116

00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:02,639

that is, how they were received
results.


117

00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,900

This is necessary in order to
to achieve reproducibility of results,


118

00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:14,009

so that other scientists can
repeat your research


119

00:07:14,009 --> 00:07:19,560

or your logic of reasoning
and get approximately the same results.


120

00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,849

Articles like this
as a rule,


121

00:07:22,849 --> 00:07:26,009

differ empirically
character,


122

00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,740

that is, as a rule, in empirical
sciences specifically


123

00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:33,040

original research
articles and distributed.


124

00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,860

It is important that the scientific article
cannot be considered


125

00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:42,789

scientific without a list of references,
that is, without a list of those sources


126

00:07:42,789 --> 00:07:46,530

on which the reasoning is based,
logics


127

00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:50,210

or is it built on its own?
study.


128

00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:53,889

Finally, it is important to note
we will talk about it


129

00:07:53,889 --> 00:07:56,400

in another video, but not anyway
less,


130

00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:02,950

that, as a rule, these are the original ones
research articles today in the 21st century


131

00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:07,399

followed almost everywhere
format - the so-called IMRAD -


132

00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:11,650

– this is the format when the article
divided into introduction,


133

00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:14,710

methods, results
and discussion of the results.


134

00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:19,759

Let's see for example
performance


135

00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,240

original research
articles in a scientific journal.


136

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,970

Here, please do not delve into
to the essence of the study,


137

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:30,819

without reading the language.
I just want to demonstrate


138

00:08:30,819 --> 00:08:34,459

how important is structuring
such articles.


139

00:08:34,459 --> 00:08:38,899

Look, it's quite
Annotations are clearly visible,


140

00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:42,830

required inside the article
there are sections -


141

00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,070

like larger materials
methods, results,


142

00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:49,600

so definitely some
subsections.


143

00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,150

This is of course necessary
to speed up the healing of information,


144

00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,140

that is, we make it easier in every possible way
life


145

00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,880

our potential
readers and reviewers


146

00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,950

in order to do
material


147

00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:04,779

as accessible as possible.


148

00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:09,760

And, in the end, we definitely see
bibliography,


149

00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,700

which becomes
more and more.


150

00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,029

If earlier an approximate list
literature


151

00:09:15,029 --> 00:09:18,790

included 12, maybe 14
sources,


152

00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:21,430

then today we see 50,
and 60,


153

00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,022

and in review articles, of course,
and even more.


154

00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:29,850

So let's just talk
about the review article - review.


155

00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:34,680

Their importance especially increases
in the last 20-30 years,


156

00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,431

and this is due to the fact that
that the volume of scientific knowledge


157

00:09:39,431 --> 00:09:44,310

grows every year
in incredible progression


158

00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:46,691

geometric or what
whatever it was.


159

00:09:46,691 --> 00:09:48,940

However, some
see and talk about


160

00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:53,250

that the volume of knowledge doubles,
others say it triples,


161

00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,640

Certainly,
quite difficult to calculate.


162

00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,200

And review articles - they are intended
precisely for this purpose


163

00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:04,440

to do an analysis
already published works,


164

00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:08,860

so-called meta-analysis
and through critical analysis


165

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,040

achievements in a certain
fields of knowledge


166

00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,690

for a certain period
identify


167

00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:18,120

trends, gaps
in existing knowledge


168

00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,640

in order to be able
scientists


169

00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,709

give absolutely clear
ways of directions where to develop further.


170

00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:32,280

And a review article is a must
is based on a strict methodology,


171

00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,810

that is, it cannot be considered
for quality reviews,


172

00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,130

when it's just going
transfer


173

00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:42,870

some research or other
in one area or another.


174

00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:46,660

Of course this cannot be considered
quality review,


175

00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:50,070

this is definitely clear
Source selection methodology.


176

00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:54,260

And in connection with the fact,
that the methodologies are different,


177

00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,520

different research goals,
In fact,


178

00:10:56,520 --> 00:11:01,000

inside this review genre
there are quite a lot


179

00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:06,750

wide species diversity,
that is, there are quite a lot of types, reviews.


180

00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,040

And you and I, let's take a look
by three, let's say


181

00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,310

basic, common
type.


182

00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:16,500

We can expect
what's coming soon


183

00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:20,350

new types of reviews
will spread more and more


184

00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:23,209

but nonetheless,
So let's look at three.


185

00:11:23,209 --> 00:11:28,490

First of all, this is what is called
narrative review or narrative review,


186

00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:34,450

and its meaning is... Undoubtedly,
Have you come across reviews like this?


187

00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,020

most likely, you yourself
wrote them


188

00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:40,870

in some coursework
works, theses,


189

00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:44,690

because it's pretty
general and schematic


190

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:49,120

research descriptions
on a certain issue.


191

00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,121

Typically, for data
reviews


192

00:11:52,121 --> 00:11:56,709

not expected to be strict
source selection algorithm,


193

00:11:56,709 --> 00:11:59,300

and the significance of this kind
reviews


194

00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,490

as separate publications
very low.


195

00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:04,660

Many magazines are already stopping
accept


196

00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,000

for consideration of this kind
reviews.


197

00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:11,000

But nevertheless they are still
are important


198

00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,019

as part of larger
research.


199

00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:19,230

For example, when writing
original research articles


200

00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,570

produced exactly the same way
review of literature in this area,


201

00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:26,640

sometimes it is carried out in such
articles in a separate subsection.


202

00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:28,382

And, of course, narrative
reviews


203

00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:32,750

can't be compared
with these kinds of reviews,


204

00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:37,160

which are called systematic
reviews or systematic review.


205

00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:42,360

Already used here
very clear and precise methodology


206

00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:46,029

and scientists put specific
research questions.


207

00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:49,990

In this systematic
review implies


208

00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:53,880

not just quantitative
counting how many articles


209

00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:57,079

was published
on one issue or another,


210

00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:59,740

in such and such databases
or magazines


211

00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:04,430

with one or another quartile,
but deep reading is implied


212

00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:07,899

the sources themselves,
deep analysis of them.


213

00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:12,040

Therefore, scientists who
publish a systematic review,


214

00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,570

it is assumed that they
studied


215

00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:16,070

every detail and depth
article,


216

00:13:16,070 --> 00:13:18,990

which they include
to review.


217

00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:23,290

And finally, there's more
such a new direction -


218

00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:27,540

so-called subject review
fields or scoping review,


219

00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:30,990

and unlike systematic
review


220

00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:34,450

it's much wider here
coverage of sources.


221

00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:36,850

These types of reviews can
include


222

00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:40,640

both 200 and 300 sources
and analyze them.


223

00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:46,440

And the purpose of this kind of reviews
– establish the boundaries of the subject field


224

00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,860

by search, continuous
searching for sources -


225

00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:51,889

be it national bases,


226

00:13:51,889 --> 00:13:55,180

international bases,
that is, it is desirable


227

00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,970

so that scientists can
gain access


228

00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:01,370

to the largest possible
variety of articles published.


229

00:14:01,370 --> 00:14:05,149

And then it is produced according to
methodology,


230

00:14:05,149 --> 00:14:09,700

classification, systematization,
categorization,


231

00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,120

deep data analysis
sources.


232

00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:14,160

Currently like this
kind of reviews,


233

00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:18,980

they are also widely used
and are very, very appreciated.


234

00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:22,170

It must be said that in Russia
review articles


235

00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:27,070

as a species, as a separate genre,
as a separate type


236

00:14:27,070 --> 00:14:29,580

are already starting to spread
actively.


237

00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:33,959

And look, many
researchers


238

00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,480

follow exactly this one
logic,


239

00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:41,220

when first determine
research questions,


240

00:14:41,220 --> 00:14:44,160

then they make a selection
research


241

00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,840

taking into account certain criteria,
and then determine the direction of development.


242

00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,010

Look, in this
case with us...


243

00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:59,810

We see with you that scientists
not only just take away,


244

00:14:59,810 --> 00:15:01,740

carry out quantitative
assessment,


245

00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,240

but also deep quality
analysis.


246

00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:08,161

And finally, let's move on
to a short message.


247

00:15:08,161 --> 00:15:12,759

This is also very important
and a rapidly developing genre


248

00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:16,800

scientific articles,
type of scientific articles.


249

00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:21,250

There are different names
you will see not only short communications,


250

00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:24,100

you will see this section
like letters - letters


251

00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,350

or commentaries - comments,


252

00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,589

but nevertheless, one way or another
otherwise,


253

00:15:28,589 --> 00:15:32,470

this is absolutely certain
type of study,


254

00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,759

when scientists for some reason
reasons


255

00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:38,310

need it quickly
report that


256

00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:42,690

that they noticed something
outstanding effect.


257

00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:46,839

And in this case, in order to
to fix


258

00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:50,019

your priority for this
acquired knowledge,


259

00:15:50,019 --> 00:15:52,350

it makes sense to publish
such,


260

00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:54,490

so-called short
message.


261

00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:57,690

Brief messages in comparison
with original articles


262

00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:03,190

are cited more
this has already been proven,


263

00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,459

and there are even some
satellite magazines


264

00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:09,180

to the main large magazines,


265

00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,800

which publish only
short messages.


266

00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,639

Definitely this kind
content is reviewed,


267

00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,970

that is, exactly the same
like any scientific article,


268

00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,000

they are very exposed
strict analysis procedure,


269

00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,850

they also contain lists
literature.


270

00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:30,500

And here's an interesting point:
that the number of references,


271

00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:32,370

number of sources
on the list


272

00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:36,570

often comparable to full-fledged ones
big articles.


273

00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:41,740

Of course, just like the word says
"short message"


274

00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:44,089

this kind of publication
smaller in size.


275

00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:47,871

If the usual original
research article


276

00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:54,579

may include 40-50
thousand characters or 5-6 thousand words,


277

00:16:54,579 --> 00:16:58,500

then short messages are
usually 2-3 thousand words,


278

00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,220

but nevertheless, they also include figures and tables,


279

00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:07,970

and the same requirements apply to them,
as for traditional work,


280

00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,949

namely relevance,
novelty, significance.


281

00:17:11,949 --> 00:17:16,010

In Russia short messages
are also starting to develop


282

00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,199

and on this slide you see
magazine article


283

00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,210

"University management:
practice and analysis",


284

00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:27,780

where they are published in the section
"Cases of best practices"


285

00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,030

essentially short messages.


286

00:17:30,030 --> 00:17:34,420

We see with you what is here
There is also an annotation


287

00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:38,020

and also inside the article itself
division occurs


288

00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:42,990

or separate
subheadings, introductions, and so on.


289

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,780

Where can we even be with you?
look,


290

00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:49,929

Here we are preparing our publication,
what type of article to choose,


291

00:17:49,929 --> 00:17:55,260

Which genre does it fit into?
our scientific research?


292

00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:59,530

And in this case
will help you and me


293

00:17:59,530 --> 00:18:02,039

instructions for authors
in a scientific journal.


294

00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:06,520

She is the one
the most important source of information.


295

00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:11,720

Many editors complain
that authors submit articles


296

00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:17,299

for consideration, preliminary
without reading the instructions for authors,


297

00:18:17,299 --> 00:18:21,400

which definitely exists
on the website of any scientific journal.


298

00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,730

Why is it important?


299

00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:26,410

Because it's in the instructions
for authors reported


300

00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:30,370

about what topics you are interested in
magazine,


301

00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:33,830

what types of articles,
be it review articles


302

00:18:33,830 --> 00:18:37,070

either original or short
messages


303

00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:39,740

more interested in this
specific edition.


304

00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:42,850

The point is that there are some
magazines,


305

00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,730

which publish only
reviews,


306

00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,690

but there is, as I already mentioned,
magazines,


307

00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:49,880

which publish only
short messages,


308

00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:53,049

therefore, this is very important
study the instructions,


309

00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:57,470

before submitting yours
work for this magazine.


310

00:18:57,470 --> 00:19:00,100

In addition, in this section
reported


311

00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,870

about the review policy,
how long does it take,


312

00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,940

how many reviewers research
article,


313

00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:11,809

who can be considered the author,
and who cannot be considered the author.


314

00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,330

Let me give you an example:
can he be considered the author?


315

00:19:14,330 --> 00:19:17,200

scientific article
translator, for example,


316

00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,030

From Russian into English
language,


317

00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,549

who translated this article?
That is, this is also regulated


318

00:19:23,549 --> 00:19:26,330

everything is in the instructions for authors.


319

00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:29,490

Some magazines offer
paid services,


320

00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,130

for example, by design
lists of references,


321

00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:35,710

and in this case in the instructions
this is also discussed.


322

00:19:35,710 --> 00:19:39,240

And finally, important information
About,


323

00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:42,610

in what style to present
bibliography


324

00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:45,620

and format this
manuscript.


325

00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:51,340

It would be wrong to think
that publication of a scientific article


326

00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:55,220

– it’s a quick and simple process,
when we submit our article


327

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:59,000

and within a month we see her
on the pages of magazines.


328

00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,289

Unfortunately, it is not.


329

00:20:01,289 --> 00:20:05,580

This process takes
for a long time,


330

00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:08,330

it could be six months,
maybe even a year.


331

00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:13,150

Of course, publishing houses
where exists


332

00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:15,789

very effective business model


333

00:20:15,789 --> 00:20:18,179

(for example, publishing house
MDPI) -


334

00:20:18,179 --> 00:20:22,049

this process is reduced
up to a month, or even two,


335

00:20:22,049 --> 00:20:25,190

but nevertheless the logic of passage
articles


336

00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,919

remains approximately the same.


337

00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:28,919

Let's take a look at it.


338

00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:32,490

First, scientists submit their
manuscript.


339

00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:35,409

Actually at this stage
can't talk yet


340

00:20:35,409 --> 00:20:39,690

that this is a scientific article,
most likely this is a manuscript


341

00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:42,600

for consideration in this
magazine.


342

00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:48,840

And first the editors, as well
special machine systems


343

00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,309

are researching this article


344

00:20:50,309 --> 00:20:54,340

and may be rejected due to
Togo,


345

00:20:54,340 --> 00:20:56,340

that she doesn't match
subject matter


346

00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,510

or the authors are not enough
attentively


347

00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:02,520

read the instructions for
authors in this journal.


348

00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:05,910

And they may reject
according to other formal requirements -


349

00:21:05,910 --> 00:21:10,400

for example, a list of references
presented incorrectly


350

00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:12,720

and of course
if the borrowing level


351

00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,690

in this article exceeds
stipulated limits,


352

00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,640

then in this case, of course,
the article is rejected.


353

00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:25,350

But if the manuscript
this rough sieve has passed through,


354

00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:29,320

then the process happens
the so-called review


355

00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:31,360

in English it's called
peer review.


356

00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,080

In this case, this work
sent to reviewers.


357

00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,501

In this case, two are depicted,
but actually


358

00:21:38,501 --> 00:21:42,670

it could be one reviewer,
if the area is very narrow.


359

00:21:42,670 --> 00:21:46,270

Or maybe, on the contrary,
be three or even more reviewers.


360

00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:50,630

In my practice I once
faced with a situation


361

00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:53,929

when the magazine used
12 reviewers.


362

00:21:53,929 --> 00:21:59,179

Their task is to analyze
read the article carefully


363

00:21:59,179 --> 00:22:03,480

and give your conclusion
about its quality.


364

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,200

Naturally, at the forefront -
scientific quality.


365

00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,630

Reviewers report
about your decision


366

00:22:09,630 --> 00:22:13,000

editor-in-chief,
which, taking into account


367

00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,340

and weighing various factors,
makes a decision -


368

00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,850

or reject the article,
or send for revision.


369

00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:24,500

In general, in principle,
there is a third option,


370

00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:28,150

when the article is accepted
without comments,


371

00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:31,190

but it happens like this
it's rare that even


372

00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,030

usually does not turn on
into algorithms,


373

00:22:34,030 --> 00:22:37,240

in the description of the publication process.


374

00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:38,830

After finalizing the article
authors


375

00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,370

send it back to the editor,


376

00:22:41,370 --> 00:22:46,470

and this circle can repeat itself
two or three times until


377

00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:49,620

editor-in-chief for now
will not consider this article


378

00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:53,990

suitable for publication,
what the authors are informed about


379

00:22:53,990 --> 00:22:56,950

And then it happens
the publishing process itself,


380

00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:02,340

and this is where the manuscript is already
becomes a scientific article.


381

00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,850

So, we've talked
and looked


382

00:23:05,850 --> 00:23:08,000

for different types of scientific
articles.


383

00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,320

And I hope that this
the information will be useful to you,


384

00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:17,299

when you search
ideal article type


385

00:23:17,299 --> 00:23:20,510

for your spent
research.


386

00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,010

Thank you.
