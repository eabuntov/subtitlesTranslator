00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:02,000

Good afternoon, dear listeners.


2

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,960

Today we will get to know you
with digital services


3

00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:11,080

for grant application activity
and some features of this activity.


4

00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,520

"Grant" - from the English "gift" - is a targeted financial subsidy,


5

00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,760

which is provided to scientists for scientific research.


6

00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,840

Grants are allocated from the federal budget,


7

00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,960

from the budgets of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and specialized non-profit funds,


8

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,480

charitable foundations and various international foundations.


9

00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,760

One of the largest grant funds


10

00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,480

on the territory of the Russian Federation is the Russian Science Foundation.


11

00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,920

It is a non-profit organization


12

00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:51,760

created for the purpose of financing and organizational support of scientific activities.


13

00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,280

The Russian Science Foundation subsidizes scientific research in a number of areas,


14

00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,320

which, in general, cover the main areas of scientific activity.


15

00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,920

They are shown on the slide; we will not dwell on them in more detail.


16

00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,840

Here is the start page of the information and analytical system


17

00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,200

Russian Science Foundation.


18

00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,920

It will appear in front of you as soon as you register and enter your username and password.


19

00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:19,120

It contains a number of tabs.


20

00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:28,680

This is information about current or already held competitions in calendar format, and, in fact,


21

00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,640

already with the “create request” button active
you can start creating requests right here.


22

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,200

Next is the participant form, which you should definitely fill out, since the information in the application


23

00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,720

downloaded from here


24

00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:56,280

that is, this is both personal information and information about the experience of participating in scientific projects,


25

00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:57,960

awards and publications received,


26

00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,080

All this must be filled out in this tab, which is called “Questionnaire”.


27

00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:12,040

Next is the “Application” tab, it works, in fact, as an aggregator,


28

00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,960

that is, this is the history of your applications, supported or unsupported


29

00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:18,760

as a participant and as a leader.


30

00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,600

You can return to it at any time
and look at both the competition documentation,


31

00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:31,120

and, in fact, everything that you stated and promised to the grant fund.


32

00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,960

Next, the “Organizations” tab is the organization,


33

00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:40,280

to which you are attached, that is, in our case it is the Ural Federal University,


34

00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,920

and you should definitely check this point before submitting your application.


35

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:50,560

And “Fund Contacts” - information for feedback, information about


36

00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:58,400

where to send a printed version of your application, it is presented on the last tab.


37

00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,240

The Next Big Grant Fund


38

00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:04,080

is the Grants Council of the President of the Russian Federation,


39

00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,080

which was created for state support of young Russian scientists and leading scientific schools.


40

00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,520

The Presidential Grants Council distributes Presidential grants for young scientists,


41

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:19,040

Presidential scholarships and some personal scholarships


42

00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,440

also for young scientists working in certain areas of scientific activity.


43

00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,720

Before you is the information and analytical system of the Grant Council of the President of the Russian Federation.


44

00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:39,800

It includes a start page and, in fact, a number of pages that are dedicated to


45

00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,319

grant application activities.


46

00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,760

The start page provides up-to-date information about current


47

00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:53,280

and completed competitions, also general information and some scientific analytics.


48

00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:59,720

For example, here are the competition participants and various materials,


49

00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,720

related to the activities of this fund itself.


50

00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,440

Basic information is available to users


51

00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:13,320

who have registered as participants in specific grant competitions.


52

00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:21,280

This is the grant’s personal page, this is contact information, these are questions,


53

00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,120

which you can ask technical support,


54

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,560

the history of the grant, in fact, everything you stated,


55

00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:33,320

this is a history of data changes and some instructions about how


56

00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,880

how to work with this system, and what you can do, write a review


57

00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:44,840

in order to somehow be able to improve this system.


58

00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,440

Let's consider the main stages of the grant application activities of scientists, there are seven of them.


59

00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:52,680

First of all, if you want


60

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,880

To apply for a grant, you must carefully read the competition documentation.


61

00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,200

Next - register in the appropriate digital system,


62

00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:05,880

All grant applications today are submitted through the system,


63

00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:09,960

in some cases it is necessary to attach a paper original,


64

00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,200

in some cases there is no need for this.


65

00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,720

The third stage is creating an application.


66

00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,360

It is necessary to write an application in accordance with the competition documentation


67

00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,760

and upload it accordingly to the digital service.


68

00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:29,520

Next, the project team is formed in the system and the application is edited.


69

00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,320

The sixth step is submitting an application.


70

00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,000

And then the application goes through several stages of consideration within the fund,


71

00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,840

and the fund publishes a list of winners within the established time frame,


72

00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:49,360

and, in fact, at this stage it will be possible to get acquainted with the results of the competitive selection.


73

00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,440

As you can see, the grant application procedure is quite multi-stage,


74

00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,400

and each stage requires some effort.


75

00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,040

We will look at the main elements of a well-prepared or, as I call it,


76

00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,240

good grant application.


77

00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:11,960

It should contain a title page, which should contain the title, authors,


78

00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:17,560

a list of keywords and annotation for your application.


79

00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,760

The abstract is what the expert will definitely read first.


80

00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,400

It is important to remember that the expert is a very busy person and the abstract is a kind of advertisement according to which,


81

00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,720

in general, in the first minutes it will become clear whether your application is a winning one or not,


82

00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:39,040

Therefore, great attention is always paid to writing annotations.


83

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,760

Keywords.


84

00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,080

An experienced keyword expert is immediately able to assess the problem and task,


85

00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:53,480

which you designate, and at this stage also make some decisions for yourself.


86

00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,240

Information about the manager and main executors of the project.


87

00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,840

At this point, please do not forget to praise yourself,


88

00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,560

provide a list of your publications, scientific background, some leadership experience


89

00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,440

and the completion of previous projects that you and your project team have received awards.


90

00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,640

All this will, of course, have a positive effect on the results of consideration of your application.


91

00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:26,240

And the main content of the project, which includes a number of points -


92

00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,040

this is a scientific problem that the project aims to solve,


93

00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:34,480

this is, in fact, the problem that your project is intended to solve.


94

00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:40,280

It should be written in sufficient detail, but at the same time succinctly in order to


95

00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:45,480

so that it is clearly clear what your project is aimed at.


96

00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:48,640

As a rule, scientific significance is highlighted as a separate item


97

00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:51,160

and the relevance of solving the identified problem,


98

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:59,547

that is, what question, what burning topic


99

00:07:59,547 --> 00:08:00,880

affects your project and how it is intended to solve it,


100

00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,240

a specific task or tasks within the problem,


101

00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,480

which the project aims to solve.


102

00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,880

There may be one task, or there may be several,


103

00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:15,760

It is recommended to do from five to seven tasks so that it is clear, in general,


104

00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:22,320

how do you see, among other things, the breakdown of your project into stages.


105

00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,880

Scientific novelty of the research and justification for the achievability of the results –


106

00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:31,560

this is a kind of literary review, this is something that already exists


107

00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,680

in conjunction with the current state of research, this is point five,


108

00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,480

and how exactly your research is different, what new you bring to the scientific community,


109

00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,880

what results do you plan to achieve and how new, original and significant are they,


110

00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:56,960

and to what extent, of course, they are achievable within the framework of the project - time and resources.


111

00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,840

The next stage is the proposed methods and approaches,


112

00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,720

how will you achieve your goal,


113

00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,680

what modern scientific methods you will use.


114

00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:12,480

Maybe you offer some of your own original approaches, of course, about this


115

00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,000

worth writing in this paragraph.


116

00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:21,280

You should also outline the general work plan for the entire implementation period and the expected results.


117

00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,200

A general work plan is sometimes required, broken down by performer


118

00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:31,360

or it may be designated as a schedule.


119

00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:36,200

It is worth noting the scientific groundwork that the research team has


120

00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:39,520

as in the summary, as in the information about the managers,


121

00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:46,320

and in a separate paragraph, briefly, concisely, but at the same time, describe it sufficiently fully.


122

00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,640
