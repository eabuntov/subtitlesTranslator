Good afternoon, dear graduate students and young scientists!

00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:06,160

My name is Telepaeva Daria,

8

00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:36,480

as well as about those support measures that
available only at our University.


9

00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:39,680

And I'll start with an important scholarship,

00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,680

which is paid regularly

13

00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:59,920

To receive this scholarship you must
should only study for “excellent” grades.


14

00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:08,000

That is, even one “four” is already
ineligibility for this scholarship.


15

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,800

In addition to excellent academic performance, you must have


16

00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:15,600

outstanding abilities in
educational and scientific activities,


17

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,200

you can either be a winner

18

00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,680

if this direction suits you and
matches your field of study.


19

00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:34,840

You may have patents, scientific articles in leading
scientific or Russian or foreign publications,


20

00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,320

you can have different performances
at scientific conferences and so on,


21

00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,160

that is, all your achievements,
that you can brag about


22

00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,040

precisely as a young scientist, as a graduate student,


23

00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:52,360

who has behind him
already a certain background.


24

00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:57,440

Amount of this scholarship
is 1,500 rubles. monthly,


25

00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:03,920

year, that is, assigned to you from September 1.


26

00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:11,520

And until August 31st throughout the academic year
you are the recipient of this scholarship.


27

00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800

It is important to note that this scholarship
is paid to you only once,


28

00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,680

that is, you will not receive
1,500 rub. every month,


29

00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,640

you will receive 18,000 rubles immediately for all 12 months.


30

00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,560

And if you want to apply next year
application for this scholarship,


31

00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,520

then you will have to go through the competitive procedures again


32

00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,560

and re-prepare the application
those existing scientific achievements,


33

00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,760

which you have, and go through this competition again.


34

00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:54,080

The next scholarship that is available to everyone
graduate students, all students of the Sverdlovsk region,


35

00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,880

is the first President's scholarship
Russia of Boris Nikolaevich Yeltsin.


36

00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:05,240

It also implies that you

37

00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:10,400

and you have outstanding abilities
in educational and scientific activities,


38

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,920

they are absolutely similar here, as for
scholarships from the governor of the Sverdlovsk region.


39

00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:25,280

The amount of this scholarship is 4,000 rubles.
monthly, it is paid immediately for a year,


40

00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,120

but you get these payments
only once a semester,


41

00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,080

that is, once every six months at a time
24,000 rubles will arrive.


42

00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,720

both in the first and second semester.


43

00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,000

And if you want next year
also apply for this scholarship,


44

00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,360

then you will also have to
new to take part in this competition,


45

00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,120

since the scholarship is paid
only for one academic year.


46

00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,480

Another important support measure
which is available to our young scientists,


47

00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,760

is the Governor's Award

which are confirmed by various
publications, patents,


51

00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,720

participation in leading scientific conferences
and various other ways.


52

00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,440

The prize is awarded to the young
a scientist who is not yet 35 years old,


53

00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,080

and it is awarded annually in 22 categories.


54

00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:36,000

The size of each award is 200,000 rubles.


55

00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:43,640

That is, once a year the Governor personally from his own hands
presents a prize to twenty-two young scientists.


56

00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:48,200

And it is very prestigious,
a very serious reward,


57

00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:55,520

which, indeed, opens up many
opportunities for you as a young scientist.
