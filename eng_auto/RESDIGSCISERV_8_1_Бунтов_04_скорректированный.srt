00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440

Good afternoon, dear colleagues.


2

00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,400

Today we will talk about scientific positioning
universities at the global level.


3

00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,560

From the point of view of an outside observer - be
then an applicant, an administrator of another university,


4

00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,800

a simple man in the street - the quality and level of the university


5

00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,520

determined by international
university rankings,


6

00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,080

which exist in different countries.


7

00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,960

Key positioning factors
universities in these rankings are


8

00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,960

quality of research, that is
quantity and quality of publications,


9

00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,120

citation level, results that
are transformed into technologies and developments,


10

00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,320

the international cooperation.


11

00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520

The higher the percentage of international
collaboration between university scientists,


12

00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,480

as well as international exchange programs
indicate the high level of the university.


13

00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,040

Academic reputation is determined by
based on surveys of experts in a similar field.


14

00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,280

Academic reputation is determined based on
surveys of academic experts and employers,


15

00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680

lists of which annually
are formed by universities,


16

00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,000

are sent to international rankings
agencies for conducting surveys.


17

00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,760

In their questionnaires, experts can indicate


18

00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,520

which universities do they consider the most
prestigious and authoritative.


19

00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,360

Based on similar responses and
international ratings are being formed.


20

00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040

And finally, an important role is played
funding and its volume for each university.


21

00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880

Funding evidence
about the level of the university and trust


22

00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,480

from foundations and government
and private organizations.


23

00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,960

The most famous are
three international ratings.


24

00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,160

These are the ratings published
international agencies


25

00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,880

(such as Quacquarelli Symonds), magazines
(such as Times Higher Education)


26

00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,760

or other organizations (like Chinese
Shanghai Ranking, also called ARWU).


27

00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,480

Ratings are based on
evaluation of universities according to criteria,


28

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680

which were listed earlier.


29

00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,840

For each specific rating, a list
criteria and their weights vary slightly.


30

00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,320

That is, for the QS rating the highest
academic reputation carries weight,


31

00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,840

reputation among employers,


32

00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,200

ratio of employees and
students and specific citations,


33

00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,880

and for the Shanghai rating the main
the criteria are the quality of education,


34

00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,640

quality of teaching
composition and research results and others.


35

00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,880

For each of the three listed ratings
in its part, subject ratings are formed


36

00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,120

by subject areas
development of science and technology.


37

00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,760

As an example, here are
results of Russian universities


38

00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,880

in the QS World University Rankings
in terms of engineering and technology.


39

00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,760

On the right is the score obtained from
indicators given on the previous slide,


40

00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920

and as a result of sorting
according to the specified total score


41

00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,960

we get a university place
in the overall international ranking.


42

00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,400

As you can see, Moskovsky is in the lead here
state university with 57 places,


43

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360

a Ural Federal University
Not here in this category.


44

00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,120

Although in other categories (for example,
chemistry, physics, materials science)


45

00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,680

Ural University takes pride of place.


46

00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,080

By the QR code on the right you can find
general list of subject areas,


47

00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,800

by which the ranking is made
by Quacquarelli Symonds.


48

00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,720

If we take the Shanghai rating
and a slightly different subject area,


49

00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,440

namely the field of mathematics, then in the latter
line in the category “400-500 place”,


50

00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,920

in the category from 401 to 500th place we
we will see the Ural Federal University,


51

00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,520

since the results of his research,
graduate employment results


52

00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,360

and other parameters allowed
him to take such a place.


53

00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320

Here for the big places, above
hundreds total score is unknown,


54

00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,880

therefore, only a cohort or list is given
places where the university is located.


55

00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440

You can also find the QR code on the right
a complete list of subject areas,


56

00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560

by which the ranking is made.


57

00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520

What's in Russia?


58

00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800

There are also several ratings in Russia.


59

00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600

As an example, here is the RAEX rating,


60

00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200

however, there are others such
like the Interfax rating,


61

00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,480

Forbes magazine and other publications and organizations.


62

00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,600

It is for RAEX that the criteria are
receiving quality education,


63

00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800

level of demand
graduates by employers


64

00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,640

and the level of research activity.


65

00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,680

Universities are also analyzed
in different thematic areas -


66

00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360

from agriculture to technical sciences.


67

00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,680

Often cultural organizations in the area
cultures do not always fall into such ratings.


68

00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,460

Here is a list of universities
included in the Russian RAEX rating


69

00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,560

and those who took first place up to tenth,


70

00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720

on which the Uralsky is located
Federal University.


71

00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,680

On the right is the overall score according to the rating criteria.


72

00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600

However, due to the large
number of Russian ratings


73

00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000

(you can see a list of them on this slide)


74

00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,120

aggregate ratings appeared,


75

00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,520

which give some general rating
according to the list of special ratings.


76

00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880

In particular, there is a National
aggregate ranking of universities,


77

00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,600

which is considering hundreds of universities
Russia from a list of twelve ratings.


78

00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,760

As a result of calculating the overall indicator


79

00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,560

based on the results of individual
ratings are formed in several leagues.


80

00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,040

The Premier League includes 50 universities
(as they call it - “Top 50”),


81

00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360

the first league is “Top 100” and so on.


82

00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,720

And leagues six to nine
and a tenth are in the alarm zone.


83

00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,920

If the university is included in these leagues,
it has alarmingly low rates


84

00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,040

and must carry out active work
to improve your performance.


85

00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,960

Unfortunately, this is not the case in Russian ratings yet.
division by subject areas is common.


86

00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,600

However, you can filter, for example,
universities by affiliation


87

00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,200

to one or another ministry
or this or that industry.


88

00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,800

What needs to be done to promote
scientific and technical results of universities


89

00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,920

in international and Russian ratings?


90

00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,640

Teams within universities, including
Ural Federal University,


91

00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,280

a strategy for effective
promotion according to all criteria,


92

00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,520

including research results, alumni,


93

00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,520

international interaction and
interaction with enterprises.


94

00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,040

It is necessary to monitor the use of social
networks, especially official accounts,


95

00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,760

issue press releases regularly and
interact with scientists in academic networks,


96

00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,200

it is necessary to transfer knowledge and
participate in social events,


97

00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,000

be an active actor in this direction


98

00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520

and also actively interact both with society,


99

00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,880

so with politicians for promotion
their results and their universities.


100

00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,080

We wish good luck to our University
in promotion in scientific rankings!


101

00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,840

Thank you.
