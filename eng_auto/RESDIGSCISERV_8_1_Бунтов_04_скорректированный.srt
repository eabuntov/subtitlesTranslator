00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,400
Today we will talk about scientific positioning of universities at the global level.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,560
From the point of view of an outside observer - an applicant, an administrator or another university,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,800
the quality and level of the university is

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,520
determined by international university rankings,

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,080
that exist in different countries.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,960
Key positioning factors for universities in these rankings are

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,960
quality of research, that is quantity and quality of publications,

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,120
citation level, results that are transformed into technologies and know-how,

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,320
the international collaboration.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
The higher the percentage of international collaboration between university scientists,

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,480
as well as international exchange programs indicate the high level of the university.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,040
Academic reputation is determined based on surveys of experts in a similar field,

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,280
both academic experts and employers.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680
Lists of experts are formed by universities themselves annually,

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,000
then submitted to international rankings agencies for conducting surveys.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,760
In their questionnaires, experts can indicate

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,520
what universities do they consider the most prestigious and respected.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Based on expert responses the international rankings are formed.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
Finally, funding plays an important role for each university.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Funding indicates the level of the university and trust

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,480
from government foundations and private organizations.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,960
There are three most famous international rankings.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,160
These are the rankings published by international agencies

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,880
such as Quacquarelli Symonds, journals like Times Higher Education

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,760
or other organizations like Chinese Shanghai Ranking, previously called ARWU.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,480
Rankings are based on evaluation of universities according to criteria,

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
which were shown earlier.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,840
For each specific ranking, a list of criteria and their weights may vary.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,320
That is, for the QS rating the highest weight has academic reputation,

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,840
then reputation among employers,

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,200
ratio of employees and students, scientific citations.

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,880
For the Shanghai ranking the main criteria are the quality of education,

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,640
quality of teaching, research results and others.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,880
For each of the three listed ratingsin its part, subject rankings are formed

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,120
by subject areas in science and technology.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,760
As an example, here are the results of Russian universities

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,880
in the QS World University Rankings in engineering and technology.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,760
In the right column there is the score obtained from indicators given in the previous slide.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
The results are sorted by the specified total score.

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,960
At the left we get a university place in the overall international ranking.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,400
As you can see, Moscow State University is leading here with 57th place,

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360
while the Ural Federal University is not present in this category.

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Although in other categories, for example, chemistry, physics, materials science

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Ural University takes its place.

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,080
By the QR code on the right you can find a complete list of subject areas,

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,800
by which the ranking is madeby Quacquarelli Symonds.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,720
If we take the Shanghai ranking and a slightly different subject area,

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,440
namely the field of mathematics, then in the last line in the category of 400-500,

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,920
we will see the Ural Federal University,

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,520
since the results of its research, graduate employment results

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,360
and other parameters allowed it to take such a place.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320
Here for the places above one hundred the total score is not published,

54
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,880
therefore, only a cohort of places is given where the university is located.

55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440
You can also find the QR code on the right with a complete list of subject areas,

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
by which the ranking is made.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
What's in Russia?

58
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
There are also several rankings in Russia.

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
As an example, here is the RAEX rating,

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
however, there are others like one by Interfax,

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,480
Forbes and other organizations.

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,600
It is for RAEX that the criteria are receiving quality education,

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
level of graduates demand by employers

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,640
and the level of research activity.

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,680
Universities are also analyzed in different subject areas -

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
from agriculture to technical sciences.

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,680
Often the organizations working in the culture area do not fall into such rankings.

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,460
Here is a list of universities included in the Russian RAEX rating

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,560
and those who took first ten places,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720
on which the Ural Federal University is located.

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,680
On the right is the overall score according to the ranking criteria.

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
However, due to the large number of Russian rankings

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
(you can see a list of them on this slide)

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,120
aggregate ratings appeared,

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,520
that give some general score based on the list of special rankings.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880
In particular, there is a National aggregate ranking of universities,

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,600
It considers hundreds of universities in Russia from a list of twelve rankings.

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,760
As a result of calculating the overall indicator,

79
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,560
several leagues are formed.

80
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,040
The Premier League includes 50 universities, the Top 50,

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
the first league is Top 100 and so on.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,720
And leagues six to ten are in the alarm zone.

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,920
If the university is included in these leagues, it has alarmingly low rated

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,040
and must carry out active measures to improve its performance.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,960
Unfortunately, division by subject areas is not yet common in Russian rankings.  is common.

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,600
However, you can filter, for example, universities by affiliation

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,200
to one or another ministry or industry.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,800
What needs to be done to promote scientific and technical results of a university

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,920
in international and Russian rankings?

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Universities, including Ural Federal, form special teams to shape

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,280
a strategy for effective promotion according to all criteria,

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,520
including research results, alumni,

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,520
international interaction and interaction with busyness.

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,040
It is necessary to monitor the use of social networks, especially official accounts,

95
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,760
issue press releases regularly and interact with scientists in academic networks,

96
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,200
It is also necessary to transfer knowledge and participate in social events,

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,000
be an active actor in this direction.

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
They should also actively interact both with society and

99
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,880
with politicians for promote university achievements.

100
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,080
We wish good luck to our University with its promotion in scientific rankings!

101
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,840
Thank you.
