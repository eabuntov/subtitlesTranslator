00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,440
Good afternoon, dear colleagues.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:07,400
Today we will talk about scientific positioninguniversities at the global level.

3
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,560
From the point of view of an outside observer - bethen an applicant, an administrator of another university,

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,800
a simple man in the street - the quality and level of the university

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,520
determined by internationaluniversity rankings,

6
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:26,080
which exist in different countries.

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,960
Key positioning factorsuniversities in these rankings are

8
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:35,960
quality of research, that isquantity and quality of publications,

9
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,120
citation level, results thatare transformed into technologies and developments,

10
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,320
the international cooperation.

11
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,520
The higher the percentage of internationalcollaboration between university scientists,

12
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,480
as well as international exchange programsindicate the high level of the university.

13
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:03,040
Academic reputation is determined bybased on surveys of experts in a similar field.

14
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:09,280
Academic reputation is determined based onsurveys of academic experts and employers,

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,680
lists of which annuallyare formed by universities,

16
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:19,000
are sent to international rankingsagencies for conducting surveys.

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,760
In their questionnaires, experts can indicate

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,520
which universities do they consider the mostprestigious and authoritative.

19
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,360
Based on similar responses andinternational ratings are being formed.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
And finally, an important role is playedfunding and its volume for each university.

21
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,880
Funding evidenceabout the level of the university and trust

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,480
from foundations and governmentand private organizations.

23
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,960
The most famous arethree international ratings.

24
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,160
These are the ratings publishedinternational agencies

25
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:59,880
such as Quacquarelli Symonds, magazinessuch as Times Higher Education

26
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,760
or other organizations like ChineseShanghai Ranking, also called ARWU.

27
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:12,480
Ratings are based onevaluation of universities according to criteria,

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,680
which were listed earlier.

29
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,840
For each specific rating, a listcriteria and their weights vary slightly.

30
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,320
That is, for the QS rating the highestacademic reputation carries weight,

31
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,840
reputation among employers,

32
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:32,200
ratio of employees andstudents and specific citations,

33
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:36,880
and for the Shanghai rating the mainthe criteria are the quality of education,

34
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:42,640
quality of teachingcomposition and research results and others.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:49,880
For each of the three listed ratingsin its part, subject ratings are formed

36
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,120
by subject areasdevelopment of science and technology.

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,760
As an example, here areresults of Russian universities

38
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,880
in the QS World University Rankingsin terms of engineering and technology.

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,760
On the right is the score obtained fromindicators given on the previous slide,

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,920
and as a result of sortingaccording to the specified total score

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:22,960
we get a university placein the overall international ranking.

42
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:28,400
As you can see, Moskovsky is in the lead herestate university with 57 places,

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,360
a Ural Federal UniversityNot here in this category.

44
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:38,120
Although in other categories for example,chemistry, physics, materials science

45
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,680
Ural University takes pride of place.

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:46,080
By the QR code on the right you can findgeneral list of subject areas,

47
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,800
by which the ranking is madeby Quacquarelli Symonds.

48
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,720
If we take the Shanghai ratingand a slightly different subject area,

49
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:03,440
namely the field of mathematics, then in the latterline in the category 400-500 place,

50
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:08,920
in the category from 401 to 500th place wewe will see the Ural Federal University,

51
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,520
since the results of his research,graduate employment results

52
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,360
and other parameters allowedhim to take such a place.

53
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:22,320
Here for the big places, abovehundreds total score is unknown,

54
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,880
therefore, only a cohort or list is givenplaces where the university is located.

55
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,440
You can also find the QR code on the righta complete list of subject areas,

56
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:36,560
by which the ranking is made.

57
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,520
Whats in Russia?

58
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,800
There are also several ratings in Russia.

59
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,600
As an example, here is the RAEX rating,

60
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,200
however, there are others suchlike the Interfax rating,

61
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,480
Forbes magazine and other publications and organizations.

62
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:56,600
It is for RAEX that the criteria arereceiving quality education,

63
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,800
level of demandgraduates by employers

64
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:02,640
and the level of research activity.

65
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:07,680
Universities are also analyzedin different thematic areas -

66
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,360
from agriculture to technical sciences.

67
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,680
Often cultural organizations in the areacultures do not always fall into such ratings.

68
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:23,460
Here is a list of universitiesincluded in the Russian RAEX rating

69
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,560
and those who took first place up to tenth,

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,720
on which the Uralsky is locatedFederal University.

71
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:35,680
On the right is the overall score according to the rating criteria.

72
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,600
However, due to the largenumber of Russian ratings

73
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,000
you can see a list of them on this slide

74
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,120
aggregate ratings appeared,

75
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,520
which give some general ratingaccording to the list of special ratings.

76
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,880
In particular, there is a Nationalaggregate ranking of universities,

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:05,600
which is considering hundreds of universitiesRussia from a list of twelve ratings.

78
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,760
As a result of calculating the overall indicator

79
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:13,560
based on the results of individualratings are formed in several leagues.

80
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,040
The Premier League includes 50 universitiesas they call it - Top 50,

81
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:22,360
the first league is Top 100 and so on.

82
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,720
And leagues six to nineand a tenth are in the alarm zone.

83
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:33,920
If the university is included in these leagues,it has alarmingly low rates

84
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:39,040
and must carry out active workto improve your performance.

85
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:44,960
Unfortunately, this is not the case in Russian ratings yet.division by subject areas is common.

86
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,600
However, you can filter, for example,universities by affiliation

87
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,200
to one or another ministryor this or that industry.

88
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:01,800
What needs to be done to promotescientific and technical results of universities

89
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,920
in international and Russian ratings?

90
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,640
Teams within universities, includingUral Federal University,

91
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,280
a strategy for effectivepromotion according to all criteria,

92
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,520
including research results, alumni,

93
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,520
international interaction andinteraction with enterprises.

94
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,040
It is necessary to monitor the use of socialnetworks, especially official accounts,

95
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:32,760
issue press releases regularly andinteract with scientists in academic networks,

96
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:38,200
it is necessary to transfer knowledge andparticipate in social events,

97
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,000
be an active actor in this direction

98
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,520
and also actively interact both with society,

99
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,880
so with politicians for promotiontheir results and their universities.

100
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,080
We wish good luck to our Universityin promotion in scientific rankings!

101
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,840
Thank you.
