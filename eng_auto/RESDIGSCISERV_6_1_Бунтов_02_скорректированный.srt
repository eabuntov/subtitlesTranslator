00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,720
Good afternoon, dear colleagues!

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,720
Today we will talk about modern methods for assessing the scientific performance of a researcher.

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,120
The question may arise: who and why needs to evaluate a researcher scientific performance

4
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080
There can be many answers to this question including his administration,

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,040
scientific supervisor and other interested organizations and individuals.

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,960
But we talk about the main thing for graduate students and researchers:

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,760
reasons why we should be concerned about evaluating our scientific performance.

8
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,680
I think we all participate or we want to participate in scientific grants.

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,800
Now if we look at the application for a grant from the Russian Science Foundation, the main scientific funding body

10
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,400
in the field of natural sciences and engineering

11
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,920
then in each application it is mandatory for the scientific team

12
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880
to indicate the planned results of the project.

13
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,120
In particular the number of publications that will be published in journals

14
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,240
indexed in the Web of Science and Scopus databases,

15
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,320
in the database of the Russian Science Citation Index or eLibrary

16
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,160
and other databases.

17
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,600
We also describe in which journals we plan to publish our work

18
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,960
and to which quartile these journals belong, by which indicator .

19
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360
As a result, after completing the project, a scientific report is generated

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,160
in which we fill out the list of published works.

21
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,880
They are automatically divided into categories

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,560
whether they belong to Web of Science or Scopus, which quartiles and so on.

23
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,800
Based on this list the following statistical table is formed

24
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,040
which is presented in the slide.

25
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,640
It compares the planned indicators of the application with actual indicators

26
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,000
for each year of the project.

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,760
The second example of an assessment that we are subject to is the Priority 2030 program.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,520
It is known that the Ural Federal University is an active participant

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,840
of the federal program Priority 2030 for the development of the scientific component of universities.

30
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,320
The rules of this program were approved by the order of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education

31
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,080
Russian Federation dated May 31, 2021 and are still actual.

32
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,440
In particular, these rules include two main scientific indicators:

33
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,840
the number of publications in scientific journals of

34
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,880
the first and second quartiles based on Web of Science data.

35
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,280
The second indicator is the number of publications

36
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280
indexed in the Scopus database and classified in the first and second quartiles by SNIP.

37
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,840
The first indicator is calculated according to the impact factor from Web of Science,

38
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,920
the second indicator is based on SNIP from the Scopus database.

39
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,720
Co-authored publications are necessarily taken into account based on the fractional counting method.

40
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,120
That is if an article has several authors, each of these authors has several affiliations,

41
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,480
then the organization is awarded only a fraction of the point for each publication.

42
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,560
What is SNIP?

43
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,680
This is the source-normalized impact factor of an article.

44
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,240
The indicator was proposed by Elsevier and it

45
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,960
allows to compare sources from different subject areas

46
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,200
and evaluate journal impact with citation weighting

47
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,640
compared to the total number of citations in the subject area.

48
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,120
Its numerator is the average number of links

49
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,320
and the denominator is the average citation in the subject area.

50
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,200
Thus we can easily compare different subject areas with each other.

51
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,080
Fractional counting is a method of counting of coauthored scientific articles.

52
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760
where the articles are taken into account as shares

53
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320
which are distributed between organizations from different affiliations

54
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,720
and the authors share which depends on the number of authors in the article.

55
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,120
The factional score is calculated using this formula that is the sum of factional points

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,080
It cannot exceed unity for each article and in total for the organization

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,120
the sum is calculated for all authors

58
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,760
for all affiliations taking into account the factional account in the level of authors.

59
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,480
From the rector report for 2022 we see

60
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,680
that in our Ural Federal University from the total of 1000

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200
only a little over 300 shares are counted to the University

62
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,960
that is approximately 13% of the points.

63
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,160
The rest relates either to other organizations of the Russian Federation

64
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,000
or to international partners.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680
On what basis can we ourselves or our partners,

66
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,680
foundations or administration evaluate our scientometric indicators?

67
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,560
Lets move on to a practical level and look at the data sources for such an assessment.

68
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,920
So where can you find information about your own publications and scientometric indicators?

69
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,000
Naturally the history of publications can and should be preserved

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,360
on paper or in electronic formats.

71
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,000
However it is convenient to search in electronic database systems

72
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,800
such as for example the electronic scientific library eLibrary.ru.

73
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,120
Here we can go to the directory of authors and search by last name

74
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,680
I will use my own last name throughout for simplicity

75
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,680
You can find your own person by last name especially if you are registered in the system.

76
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,760
For example, Evgeniy Aleksandrovich Buntov and by clicking on the list of the publications

77
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:07,640
or a chart with indicators you can quickly find the values you need.

78
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,880
These are the values that will be used by Russian organizations and scientists

79
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,480
to assess your scientific performance.

80
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:21,360
You can easily track your list of publications at orcid.org

81
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,040
This especially applies to foreign publications.

82
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:33,720
In the search you can enter your own last name and quickly find your account

83
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,560
with a list of publications if you are registered in the system,

84
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:46,120
which is updated automatically upon publication in international scientific journals.

85
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,440
We can even use the Scopus database which has limited access.

86
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:59,400
Nevertheless we can always find our author profile by our last name, first name and affiliation.

87
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,080
The advantage of Scopus is that it has a quite clean

88
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:11,720
list of publications of each author taking into account duplication of his profiles,

89
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:17,680
as well as minimal analytics right here on the authors page.

90
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,160
Naturally we can always use Google search.

91
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,960
Google has a special service called Google Scholar.

92
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
in which we can search by the author surname,

93
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,880
find his profile or at least a list of publications of this author

94
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:41,080
and conduct basic analytics or find specific publications,

95
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,760
that the author has published during his work.

96
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:52,080
Finally if we register in the ResearchGate system

97
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,040
(a social network for scientists), we will be able to track relevant publications

98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:06,240
We will also be able to search by various criteria in the extensive ResearchGate database,

99
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,160
and also request full texts from various authors

100
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,720
if these full texts are not publicly available on the Internet.

101
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,680
In recent years, with the advent of neural networks and artificial intelligence,

102
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,040
a whole set of new services has appeared: scientific data aggregators

103
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:34,760
that include data from several databases at once, such as Scopus and Web of Science, Google Scholar and others.

104
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,080
One example of such systems is Crossref,

105
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:46,760
where you can search for metadata to find your publications from different publishers,

106
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:54,160
from abstracts to scientific articles, patents and other types of work.

107
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:02,280
Lens.org has similar capabilities where we can search for patents,

108
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:11,280
scientific papers, scientist profiles and other related information.

109
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:19,480
The system immediately offers us the scientists profile linked to the number and displays it.

110
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:25,000
During the process of opening a profile the system loads data from different databases.

111
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:32,200
Thus we can see the overall picture including scientometric indicators

112
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:39,120
depending on the year of works publication and some metadata about the scientist.

113
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,560
In the scientists profile that opens you can see the number of his works,

114
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,160
various scientometric indicators, distribution of publications over time,

115
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,880
a list of the same publications with labels about their quality and affiliations,

116
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:59,120
as well as the primary affiliation and additional affiliations of the scientist.

117
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:13,320
An alternative system is based on artificial intelligence: Semantic Scholar

118
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:24,560
where you can select your own from existing researcher profiles and also see a list of your publications.

119
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:34,920
The same search can be carried out in the Scilit system.

120
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,560
As you can see, all of these systems pull information about scientist profiles from the ORCID system.

121
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,160
Therefore we recommend registering

122
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:50,440
in this system and track the list of your publications in it.

123
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:56,040
The Scilit system already has some basic ability to analyze your publications

124
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,880
in particular distribution by topic areas, by types of publications

125
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,689
whether it is a journal or an article, a preprint or conference paper.

126
00:11:05,689 --> 00:11:12,320
However, the greatest potential for the analysis of scientometric data

127
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,120
have specialized systems,

128
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:22,160
such as SciVal from Elsevier or InCites from Web of Science.

129
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:29,000
In the SciVal system you can go to the Overview section,

130
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:36,560
go to the Researchers category, find yourself by last name and other parameters,

131
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:42,600
select from the list of authors and immediately see your parameters,

132
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:50,120
in particular the topic of publication, the H-index, FWCI and other indicators.

133
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:59,040
You can also look at the topics and topic clusters of your work.

134
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Finally, in the Benchmarking section one can compare himself with other researchers.

135
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:16,600
For example, I can compare these two people by citation.

136
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:25,120
In particular, according to the FWCI indicator based on articles and reviews only.

137
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:30,760
By choosing this metric I will see that accordingly

138
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:37,360
Dmitry Chaykin is higher than me in FWCI during the selected years.

139
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,520
Analytical charts in this section can be flexibly customized.

140
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:48,800
For instance, I can choose a quantity of the Y scale:

141
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:57,480
the number of publications in quartiles, as measured by CiteScore, SNIP or SJR.

142
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,600
For example, I want to see how many publications,

143
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:09,840
namely articles and reviews, ar published by selected scientists over the past years.

144
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:17,840
And we see for each year the number of publications in all journals in all quartiles

145
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:24,720
we can filter this indicator only for the first and second quartiles,

146
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,760
that is the top 50% of publications.

147
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,120
Thank you for your attention
