00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,720

Good afternoon, dear colleagues!


2

00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,720

Today we will talk about modern methods for assessing the scientific performance of a scientist.


3

00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,120

The question may arise: who and why needs to evaluate a scientist’s scientific performance?


4

00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,080

There can be many answers to this question - including his own administration,


5

00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:24,040

scientific supervisor and other interested organizations and individuals.


6

00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,960

But we will talk about the main thing for graduate students and researchers -


7

00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,760

reasons why we should be concerned about evaluating our scientific performance.


8

00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,680

We all, I think, participate or want to participate in scientific grants.


9

00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,800

Now, if we look at the application for a grant from the Russian Science Foundation (the main scientific fund


10

00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,400

in the field of natural sciences and engineering),


11

00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:59,920

then in each application it is mandatory when submitting the scientific team of this application


12

00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,880

indicates the planned results of the project.


13

00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:08,120

In particular, the number of publications that will be published in journals


14

00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,240

from the Web of Science, Scopus database,


15

00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,320

in the database of the Russian Science Citation Index, or eLibrary,


16

00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,160

and in publications indexed in other databases.


17

00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:26,600

We also immediately describe in which journals we plan to publish our work


18

00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,960

and to which quartile, by which indicator these journals belong.


19

00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:37,360

As a result, after completing the project, a scientific report is generated,


20

00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,160

in which we ourselves fill out the list of published works.


21

00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,880

They are automatically divided into categories,


22

00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,560

whether they belong to Web of Science, Scopus, which quartiles, and so on.


23

00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,800

Based on this list, the following statistical table is formed:


24

00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,040

which is presented on the slide.


25

00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:02,640

It compares the planned indicators of the application with actual indicators


26

00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,000

for each year of the project.


27

00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,760

The second example of an assessment that we are subject to is the Priority 2030 program.


28

00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,520

It is known that the Ural Federal University is an active participant


29

00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:22,840

federal program "Priority 2030" for the development of the scientific component of universities.


30

00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,320

The rules of this program were approved by order of the Ministry of Science and Higher Education


31

00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:33,080

Russian Federation dated May 31, 2021 and are still in effect.


32

00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,440

In particular, these rules indicate two main scientific indicators


33

00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:40,840

is the number of publications in scientific journals


34

00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:45,880

first and second quartiles based on Web of Science data.


35

00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,280

The second indicator is the number of publications,


36

00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,280

indexed in the Scopus database and classified in the first and second quartiles of SNIP.


37

00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,840

That is, the first indicator is calculated according to the impact factor from Web of Science,


38

00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,920

the second indicator is based on SNIP from the Scopus database.


39

00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,720

And joint publications are necessarily taken into account based on the fractional counting method.


40

00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,120

That is, if an article has several authors, each of these authors has several affiliations,


41

00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:20,480

then the organization is awarded only a fraction of the point for each publication.


42

00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:21,560

What is SNIP?


43

00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,680

This is the source-normalized impact factor of an article.


44

00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,240

The indicator was proposed by Elsevier,


45

00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,960

allows you to compare sources from different subject areas


46

00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:36,200

and evaluate journal impact in citation weighting.


47

00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,640

compared to the total number of citations in the subject area.


48

00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,120

Its numerator is the average number of links,


49

00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,320

and the denominator is the average citation in the subject area.


50

00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,200

Thus, we can easily compare different subject areas with each other.


51

00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,080

Fractional counting is a method of counting co-authored scientific articles.


52

00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,760

where are taken into account as shares of the article,


53

00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:03,320

which are distributed between organizations from different affiliations,


54

00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,720

and the author's share, which depends on the number of authors in the article.


55

00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:14,120

The factional score is calculated using this formula, that is, the sum of factional points


56

00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:21,080

cannot exceed one for each article and in total for the organization


57

00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,120

the sum is calculated for all authors,


58

00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:28,760

for all affiliations, taking into account the factional account of the level of authors.


59

00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:33,480

From the rector's report for 2022 we see


60

00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:38,680

that in our Ural Federal University there are approximately 1,000 more publications


61

00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,200

only a little over 300,


62

00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:45,960

that is, approximately 1/3 of the points are due to the University on the factional score.


63

00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:51,160

The rest relates either to other organizations of the Russian Federation,


64

00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,000

or to international partners.


65

00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,680

On what basis do we ourselves or our partners


66

00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,680

can funds or administration evaluate our scientometric indicators?


67

00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:09,560

Let's move on to a practical level and look at the data sources for such an assessment.


68

00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,920

So, where can you find information about your own publications and scientometric indicators?


69

00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:18,000

Naturally, history can and should be preserved


70

00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,360

of their publications on paper or in electronic formats.


71

00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,000

However, it is convenient to search in electronic database systems,


72

00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,800

such as, for example, the electronic scientific library eLibrary.ru.


73

00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,120

Here we can go to the directory of authors, and by last name


74

00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:43,680

(I will use my last name throughout for simplicity),


75

00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:50,680

You can find your own person by last name, especially if you are registered in the system.


76

00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:58,760

For example, Evgeniy Aleksandrovich Buntov and by clicking on the list of his publications


77

00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:07,640
