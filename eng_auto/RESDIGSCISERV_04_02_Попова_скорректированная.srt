00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:01,840

Hello!


2

00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:06,800

Today we will talk about
what is IMRAD format,


3

00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:10,360

what is research
article in IMRAD format,


4

00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:16,200

namely about the logical structure
and the contents of each section.


5

00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:22,160

What is the IMRAD format?
and why lately


6

00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:25,120

many Russian magazines
is it used?


7

00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:29,960

The fact is that this is a very convenient format
presentation of scientific information.


8

00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:35,040

He introduces himself, is often depicted
metaphorically in the form of an hourglass,


9

00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,760

when, look, the information, the logic of presenting it...
First, some general information is given,
 



10

00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:50,520

information in the “methods” and “results” section
is given specifically within the framework of this study,


11

00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,840

and then the process happens
the reverse, let's say, funnel,


12

00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,080

when the results obtained are interpreted,


13

00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:03,760

they are given broader meanings,
and then the conclusion is given.


14

00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:08,120

And this abbreviation IMRAD -
it entered the Russian language,


15

00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:13,240

but its meaning is essentially this:
this is an introduction,


16

00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,200

methods – methods,


17

00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,240

results, “R” is the letter in the abbreviation
- these are the results


18

00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,760

and finally, discussion –
this is a discussion of the results.


19

00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:31,800

The letter “A” is, in fact, the conjunction and.


20

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:37,560

This is the format... He received
distribution and development,


21

00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,560

In general, it went through a very long evolution,
because from the very beginning,


22

00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,760

when science was born
no one wrote in IMRAD format,


23

00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,680

and did not follow such logic,
because scientists exchanged


24

00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,400

letters in the form of essays,
in the form of some thoughts.


25

00:01:55,400 --> 00:02:01,160

And so it is attributed to Louis Pasteur,
in fact, championship.


26

00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,000

This has not been proven, but it appears
that it was he who started this logic


27

00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,480

include in your articles,
and therefore gave shape to this format.


28

00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,120

In the 70s, the IMRAD format began
actively develop, mainly


29

00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:23,200

in the English-language domain of scientific publication,
scientific communications,


30

00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:31,680

and initially it was medicine, physics, chemistry,
that is, such empirical sciences.


31

00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:37,520

But, of course, even more rapid development
he receives in 1972,


32

00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:41,760

when it was secured
in the US national standard,


33

00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,920

This is basically an analogue
to our GOSTs.


34

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:52,440

And after that, already in the 80s we see
that many magazines around the world accept it


35

00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,280

as a standard, prescribed
in the instructions for authors


36

00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,160

in various fields of science and technology.


37

00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:01,600

What is happening in Russia?


38

00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:08,480

In Russia there was a slightly unbalanced development,
and originally the IMRAD format


39

00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:15,680

developed in the following areas:
like physics, I already mentioned, and chemistry, of course,


40

00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,640

but already in the 10s, in 2010 and today
we see that it is becoming simply ubiquitous


41

00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,080

in Russian magazines, used everywhere,
even in areas where he, in general,


42

00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,560

may not have always been used before,
for example, in the field of pedagogy.


43

00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,440

Many modern magazines, Russian, for example,
magazine, "Integration of Education" -


44

00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:45,080

you can see that they are clearly
adhere to this format.


45

00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:50,560

Why? In fact, this format
has a huge number of advantages.


46

00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,000

because if we know how
the information in this article is presented,


47

00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:01,880

It's very easy for us to extract it,
because when we are ready,


48

00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,800

what if we are interested
namely research methods,


49

00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:11,200

we'll open the methods section and see
How reliable were the methods?


50

00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,680

and, accordingly, were
reliable results were obtained.


51

00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:19,880

Accordingly, it is simplified
and speeds up the review process,


52

00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,720

because reviewers don't have to
every time to delve into the logic of presentation,


53

00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,320

and, accordingly, accelerates
circulation of scientific information,


54

00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:34,520

the so-called transfer of scientific knowledge.


55

00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,840

The process of writing scientific articles
becomes less labor intensive.


56

00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:44,880

And this is a huge problem for many - especially
beginner scientists write a scientific article.


57

00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,120

And those graduate students, my graduate students,
who came to me


58

00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:58,320

many of them said that we were going into science
study physics and chemistry,


59

00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,360

and in the end we turned out to be writers,
and indeed it is.


60

00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,680

But this format makes it easier
process of writing a scientific article,


61

00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:14,480

and in the end we see that scientific knowledge,
of course it's circulating today


62

00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:21,400

much more efficient
than it was 60 years ago.


63

00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,320

Let's take a closer look
for each section,


64

00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,160

and I draw your attention to the fact that
that some sections of the article are in IMRAD format


65

00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:37,680

already more formalized
and very highly structured.


66

00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,680

Among them we will carefully look
to "Introduction" and "Methods".


67

00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,720

In the "Results" section
and “Discussion of results”


68

00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:51,040

such a strict logic of presentation, of course,
no and cannot be, but, nevertheless,


69

00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:58,840

this is precisely the “Introduction” section - this is very today
already formalized style and logic of presentation.


70

00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:02,720

The purpose of this section is to answer the question:


71

00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,560

Why was the study done at all?
who did what before?


72

00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,800

Formulate the problem, that is, find
This is a small gap in scientific knowledge,


73

00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,720

which was not covered by previous works,
describe goals and objectives


74

00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:25,240

and, in the end, give a general
